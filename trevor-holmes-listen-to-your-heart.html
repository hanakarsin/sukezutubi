What to know about 'The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart' contestant.</h2><p>Before becoming a contestant on Season 1 of the Bachelor spin-off, Trevor appeared on the singing competition series American Idol. In 2018, the reality star wowed judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and&nbsp;Lionel Richie with his audition. And, Katy could not take her eyes off the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dream boat</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>While Trevor impressed the judges during Hollywood Week, he failed to make it into the Top 24 and was eliminated from the competition.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Trevor has a girl in his life.</h2><p>If you follow the reality star on social media, you'll see that he is in love with his "baby girl", golden retriever Koda.&nbsp;</p><p>"Today, my baby girl <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kodagoldenofficial</a> turns 1! Can’t believe the things we’ve been through together in just a year. You’ve driven me absolutely insane sometimes. You’ve chewed through most of my personal belongings. You’ve had three scary trips to the vet. You’ve taught me to be more selfless and responsible," he captioned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an Instagram video</a> of the pair.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding, "Having a pup ain’t easy, but it’s worth the sacrifices. You wake me up every morning with kisses and cuddle next to me every night for bed (yes, sometimes I’m little spoon). You have shown me an unconditional love like no other. My ride or die, I love you forever. Happy bday bubba."&nbsp;</p><p>Well, if Trevor doesn't find love, at least he'll have his pup to go home to.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Trevor Holmes (@trevorholmes86)</a> on Apr 6, 2020 at 11:35am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">He's also a part-time photographer ... at least, on social media.</h2><p>Aside from working on his singing career, the California native has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a> dedicated to photography. "Wanna Be Photographer," his bio states. While he only has 20 pictures on the social media page, the Bachelor contestant's snaps include cool pics of the outdoors, his dog, portraits, and himself.&nbsp;</p><p>Not bad, Trevor. Not bad.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What we know about Trevor Holmes' journey on 'The Bachelor'. [Warning: Spoilers ahead!]</h2><p>As always, Reality Steve released a few tidbits of information regarding how this season of The Bachelor will play out. According to the spoiler guru, Trevor will make it to the finale with his partner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Gabrielle</a>. The pair will sing "Speechless" by Dan + Shay and an original song.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, the two come up short and are awarded second place by the judges. So, does their musical love story continue after the show? Well, it seems both Trevor and Jamie hit a wrong note in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Trevor allegedly never went on the show to find love, but instead hopes it will boost his singing/songwriting career.
