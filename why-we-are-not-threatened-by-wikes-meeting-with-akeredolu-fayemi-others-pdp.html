Wike, who is our performing governor, couldn’t have rejected the offer by his colleagues to visit him. Also, the visit is not meant to threaten us. We are not threatened at all because the APC were probably in Rivers State to learn from Wike.</p><p>“Let me also add that the governors have a club known as the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and its members are free to socialise and visit one another. There is nothing wrong with that. It is good for governance because beyond politics, the governors need to come together for the good of the country.”</p><p>On the return of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP, back to the country, Ologunagba said, “Anytime from now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49yZrCgqWLEpnnAq5xmpp%2BperW00Z6YrZ2emrFurthmrqKjlah6rrHEraCnn12strW0jJqinqqVmbytwYyfmLKdnZ56sMDHnqmsZaCZvXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
