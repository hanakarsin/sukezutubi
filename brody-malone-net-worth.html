Source: Getty ImagesThe U.S. men's gymnastics team has drawn a lot of attention at the 2024 Paris Olympics, thanks in part to its stacked team. Though this is the second year that gymnast Brody Malone has made it to the international sports competition, things are really looking up for Team USA this time around."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

How much is the athlete worth? Here's what we know about his finances.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Brody Malone's net worth?</h2><p>Unfortunately, it's impossible to estimate how much Brody is worth just off the knowledge that he's an Olympic athlete, but despite popular belief, making it to the Olympics <a href=#>doesn't make a person particularly rich</a>.</p><p>For much of their athletic careers, Olympic athletes have to pay for many of their expenses out of pocket. While some high-performing athletes are offered stipends to cover things like rent and food, there are plenty of professionals who have part-time jobs to support themselves.</p><p>It wasn't until 2017 that the U.S. began to pay athletes who bring home medals for their country. U.S. Olympic athletes are now paid $37,500 for each gold medal, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze. 2024 is also the first year that World Athletics decided to offer a prize of $50,000 for every gold medal awarded.</p><p>Based on these numbers, Brody has only taken home $15,000 for his bronze medal at the Olympics, which is not enough to sustain a person for even one full year.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by USA Gymnastics (@usagym)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brody Malone is a minor stakeholder and spokesperson for Endless Rope.</h2><p>Though we don't know what Brody's net worth is based on his performance in the Olympic games, we do know that he's since struck a deal to become a spokesperson and minor stakeholder in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Endless Rope</a>, an upper body workout machine that Brody himself has admitted to using in his training.</p><p>When the NCAA allowed college athletes to use their name and image to score sponsorships, this allowed for Brody to strike a deal with the company.</p><p>It's not entirely clear how much the deal is for, though at this time, it seems to be the only one he has. As a minor stakeholder in the company, he likely receives additional funds from the brand outside of his work as a spokesperson. Brody has not publicly discussed what his earnings from the company are.</p><p>Beyond this, it's not clear how else Brody is supporting himself and his athletic career, or if his family is helping him pay for his athletic expenses.</p><p>That said, being an award-winning Olympic athlete opens a variety of other avenues for Brody to earn money long after his athletic career has come to a close. As Brody is a particularly private person about his life, don't expect him to share just how much he brings in anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BwsNhmpJqkn6OybrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
