For clarity purposes, our candidate and three other aspirants met with Vice President Atiku on Monday with the sole objective to inform him of their push towards a consensus candidate for the party.</p><p>“At that meeting, there was no talk of any of the aspirants stepping down as it is yet premature. To therefore find a planted story smacks of desperation and ill-intention.</p><p>“For the avoidance of doubt, our candidate is eminently qualified for the PDP presidential as a former two-term governor, Chairman of the Governors Forum, the most engaging and result-oriented Senate President and a former presidential aspirant.</p><p>“Also, Governor Aminu Tambuwal as former Speaker of the House of Representatives and a serving two-term governor is also qualified to be considered for the ticket.</p><p>“Last but not the least is Governor Bala Mohammed, a former senator, ex-minister and a serving governor is qualified for the ticket. So, let no other aspirant hide under some nebulous assumption that he is overly qualified than others to be stepped down for. When and if there is a concrete agreement on a winning consensus and others step down for whoever, it will be done openly, but until then, Senator Bukola Saraki, Tambuwal and Mohammed are still in the race.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5JpZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6%2FwKuYpKFdqa6urtSwmKVlo6mysXnDqK6nZZakv26t06KirmWTlrqxrcigpWaslZa6br7Er5yapKNiwbPBxGaqoqyllsGqu81o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
