We had a setback; we were to remove fuel subsidy by July this year but there was a lot of pushback from the polity. We have elections coming and because of the hardship that companies and citizens went through during the COVID-19 pandemic, we just felt that the time was not right, so we pulled back on that.</p><p>“But we have been able to quietly implement subsidy removal in the electricity sector and as we speak, we don’t have subsidies in the electricity sector. We did that incrementally over time by carefully adjusting the prices at some levels while holding the lower levels down.”</p><p>Ahmed added that the government is not relenting on plans for total fuel subsidy removal as it remains the best option in the light of dwindling government resources and economic realities.</p><p>“We are currently doing a budget amendment to accommodate incremental subsidy (removal) as a result of the reversal of the decision and we want to cap it at that. Hopefully, the parliament will agree with us and we are able to continue with our plan for subsidy (removal) otherwise the way things are going we will not be able to predict where the deficit will be as a result of the fluctuation in the global market,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BrZqahnp7AtbHRZpqoppaev66%2FjKqsop2kYr%2Bmuc6vmKVln5t6prjEnKuroZOewbp50q6ZrKGUrnq0rdisZJ%2BtlaF6tMHBrKCdsV2nsq671ZqjZqyfYrOwuMuormg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
