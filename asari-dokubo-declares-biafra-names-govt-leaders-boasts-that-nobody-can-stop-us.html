They failed woefully, they will continue to fail.”</p><p>Dokubo also boasted that nobody can stop the move for Biafra as they would produce and feed themselves.</p><p>“Nobody can stop us. Nobody can blockade us as they did in the first war. We’re not going to fight any war with anybody, we’re walking to freedom.</p><p>“We will not shoot any gun with them, they will prepare their weapon but they will have nobody to kill with their weapon”.</p><p>He further called on other people who believe in Biafra to volunteer and take up roles.</p><p>The statement read in part, “We as people have resolved that as Biafra, it’s time for us to take our destiny in our hands and bring freedom to ourselves and our children and the generation of Biafrans yet unborn.</p><p>“I hesitate a little but I thank God that it’s time for us to do our duty and our service to motherland, I have accepted this role. I have dedicated my life a hundred per cent to play this role.</p><p>“My first act today in taking this position is to name those who would be on the driver’s seat to navigate through this period of tempest, this period of uncertainty with me.</p><p>“I want to call on our brother, George Onyibe to come on board to join as the secretary of the de facto customary government of the State of Biafra. He will take care of the administrative, day to day administration of the Biafra State.</p><p>“I also call on our brother Emeka Emeka Esiri to take care of the legal needs of this nascent government.</p><p>“My brothers and sisters, the four of us will kick start the process, others will come on board. We want volunteers who are committed, we want volunteers because there is nothing anymore. We are the people who have volunteered to salvage ourselves and the rest of us.</p><p>“I also call on Biafrans in the various province of the Biafra nations in Aba, Abakiliki, Anang, Awka, Calabar, Degema, Eket, Enough, Nsuka, Ogoja, Oji River, Okigwe, Onitsha, Opobo, Orlu, Owerri, Port Harcourt, Umuahia, Uyo and Yenegoa province.</p><p>“We are going to proceed to set up provincial structures of government starting with provincial assemblies and provincial governance and administrators.</p><p>“Let nobody be mistaking that a Biafra will be worse than Nigeria. There is nothing that will be worse than what we are facing today in Nigeria”.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Senator Ali Ndume</strong> (APC-Borno South) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>expressed worry over the increase in criminal activities</a></strong>, adding that security and welfare are threatened in Nigeria.</p><p>Speaking at a press briefing on Saturday, Ndume said Nigerians and the government are still not taking the security situation seriously.</p><p>He called on citizens and government to match faith with action on ensuring an urgent improvement in the security situation.</p><p>Ndume, who said the country is on a dangerous “brink”, stressed that citizens still trivialize, tribalize or give the situation religious colouration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5BtZpqrkae2brDOpKybp12ZsqS4wKucrGWSnq6nvsBmpZqllah6qLvVrWSlnZGZsrO%2FjJummqukqHq1tMCtZKenkqSxunnCmqVmq6SkvW7B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
