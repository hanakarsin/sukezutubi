Source: hboIf you're like 80 percent of the human population and are really, really into Game of Thrones, then chances are you've seen thelatest trailer drop for Season 8 of the show.
Well, it's technically not a standalone trailer, really. HBO features upcoming footage from a bunch of different series, but that hasn't stopped fans of the Realm from analyzing and breaking down every still from the little bit of footage they were given."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

HBO features upcoming footage from a bunch of different series, but that hasn't stopped fans of the Realm from analyzing and breaking down every still from the little bit of footage they were given.</p><p>The footage has confirmed a few things fans predicted would follow the events of Season 7. The biggest confirmation? That there's going to be an absolutely huge battle at Winterfell and the attack's going to be led by Mr. Night King himself.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>But thanks to some fan's snooping, we already knew that Winterfell was going to play a big part in the upcoming season. I mean, why else would they spend so much time rebuilding a physical set if they weren't going to use it for some thorough filming?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>We already know that (spoiler!) the Night King destroyed the wall with the help of the iceified and wight-ified Viserion, but could the same thing happen to Winterfell? Looks like the Night King's going to try.</p><p>Speaking of the Night King, the fact that he's so interested in Jon Snow has got a lot of people thinking that Mr. Snow himself will eventually become the "new" Night King. How so? Well, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">let this redditor</a> explain it for you. It all has to do with the bit of dragon-glass that's currently lodged in the Night King's chest.</p>"Someone has to 'pull out' the dragonglass in his chest which was used to create him in the first place. By doing this the Night King would 'die,' but unlike what happens when someone kills a 'normal' white walker, none of the creatures the Night king 'created' or turned would die. Instead they would lose the mind controlling effect the Night King has on them, and they would start doing whatever the f--k they want, i.e. rampaging around the country. To prevent this scenario from happening, someone has to take the place of the Night King by stabbing himself with the previously extracted dragonglass dagger. By doing this the person (in our mind Jon Snow) would sacrifice himself for the greater good, gaining control over all of the wights and walkers. He then would lead them back over the wall back into the north where they would stay like it has been before since the last long night (like a beast in a cage)."&nbsp;<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>If that theory sounds insane, well, I hate to break it to you, but it definitely makes a lot of sense and it could totally happen. Seeing the Night King march on Winterfell, where a final epic battle takes place against an unstoppable foe who commands and army of undead soldiers, it seems like the only choice Snow has is to take the dude's place in a vicious cycle that's plagued the realm for centuries and centuries.</p>"After that the Night King secluded himself far in the North where no one else could survive. Now over time (in the many years since the Long Night) the personality of the former Azor Ahai slowly began to decay and he finally turned into what we see now in the series as the Night King. At some point, the vanishing personality of Azor Ahai could no longer hold in check the 'evil' that was lingering inside him. At that point, the Night King started moving again, returning from the far North and slowly started creating new white walkers / wights as he had before. And thus creating an never ending, ever repeating cycle of someone becoming the Night King (saving all living beings), secluding himself in the north, losing his personality and returning as evil."&nbsp;<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>Of course, there's always tons of talk about Jon Snow — but what about some of the show's other characters? What happens to them? Like a certain Daenerys Targaryen? There are some people who predict the mother of dragons will not have a very happy ending.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>A lot of people think that Dany is going to die at the hands of the Night King, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this redditor </a>provides a convincing argument as to why Khaleesi is going to get smote by the White Walkers. So, if you're a fan of the last "true" Targaryen, then you might not want to read this.</p>Either Jon or Dany is going to die at the end of the series, but it's going to be Dany. Jon has already died and he may be the "prince who was promised", leaving Dany vulnerable. she will likely die at the hands of the Night King, but I'm not certain how it will specifically happen. In season 2, when the warlocks stole her baby dragons, she went into that creepy tower and had visions of her own demise. She envisions herself in the red keep in kings landing full of snow, just as she's about to reach out for the iron thrones she's coveted so much, she gets distracted by a sound and all of a sudden she is walking through the gates of castle black to go north of the wall. As she is walking, she sees a tent with Khal Drogo and her unborn son, which likely means that she will go to battle with the white walkers, but get killed in the process.&nbsp;<p>"Pish posh," you say. "Useless conjecture," you mutter. "Dany? Dying at the hands of the Night King? Yeah right like THAT'S going to happen," you chuckle to yourself. I agree, that would be gut-wrenching and cruel if it was ever put on screen. But may I present you with exhibit A.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: youtube</a></figure><p>That is a leaked photo of actress Emilia Clarke filming a scene with the Night King. Some fans are so convinced that she's going to be killed and turned into a wight that they even started drafting up Wight-Daenerys fan art.</p><p>Everyone's favorite Villain Queen, Cersei, also makes an appearance in the trailer and last we left her we discovered that she's "pregnant" with yet another child from Jaime.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>If you remember the old prophecy Cersei received: She was set to have three kids and no more, so either she's lying about being pregnant to play some mind games with Jaime, which might just push the guy over the edge considering how Myrcella died in his arms, and that his two other kids are now donezo, plus there's the bit of Jaime fulfilling the prophecy of becoming a Queenslayer. Cersei is a Queen, after all.</p><p>There are a ton of different theories as to how Cersei's going to bite it but everyone is 100 percent sure she will, indeed die, and by Jaime's hand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure>Cersei is going to die and the Lannisters will fall, she was prophesied at the beginning of season 4 when she was a kid that she would be a queen, have 3 children, but not with the king, and they would all die before her death. Her younger brother was also prophesied to kill her. It's going to be Jamie because Tyrion is not her true brother. Her big mistake was paying back the debt to the iron bank her father Tywin never paid with the money she just got by sacking high garden in season 7 when they killed Olenna Tyrell. "The Lannister always pay their debts" will be the undoing of her. Now that she is out of debt and the iron bank has their money back, they have the assets to back anyone they want. The iron bank was also very fond of the growing amount of interest that the Lannisters were piling up. although the Lannisters were able to use the iron bank to hire mercenaries from Essos, it won't be enough in the long run. The iron bank doesn't back losers, once they find someone else who is more worthy of their investment, they will take their side and follow the money. Her greed and lust for power has led her to make that mistake and ultimately be her demise. Jamie will kill Cersei since he is technically the younger of the two.Jamie switched sides to go help Jon and Dany take down the army of the dead because he has finally had enough of Cersei and eventually they will be on opposite sides and he will be forced to kill her because deep down he is truly good. He has finally seen the evil in Cersei everyone basically ever had told him so much about when she decided she wanted to plot against Dany and Jon while they planned to basically save the world.<p>Interestingly enough, when Jon Snow approaches Cersei in the trailer and tells her, "there's only one war that matters," the Queen responds by saying, "We'll face it together." He's probably talking about the battle against the White Walkers, but knowing Cersei, she's always got a trick up her sleeve and it's hard to trust anything that she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>Plus, immediately after that, you see Daenerys commanding her dragons to burn up some very non-wight looking soldiers. Why would she be doing that unless there's some squabble between humans that need to be quelled before they get their Night King problem under control? I mean look at that dragon, they're not playing around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>This is all very troubling news to me because as much of a villain as she is, I lowkey want Cersei to win. OK fine, HIGH-key want Cersei to win. I love her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpcF9nhXCmkKiZbIeEZLSiucRmpp9lpJ2%2FsLrErGSsnZGovK95l2aroZ2fp7amvw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
