Source: Getty ImagesWhen the chaos surrounding John Mulaney's divorce from Ann Marie Tendler hit the (social media) fan, the term &#34;parasocial relationship&#34; also started making the rounds online too. That's because people felt like they knew John; his hilarious everyman comedy (in which he often talked about how much he loved his wife) made it feel like we were all his friend."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's because people felt like they knew John; his hilarious everyman comedy (in which he often talked about how much he loved his wife) made it feel like we were all his friend. And so none of us could reconcile this with the fact that he'd been supposedly cheating on Anna Marie nonstop while relapsing into addiction.</p><p>And while so many of us mainly knew Anna because of John, the multimedia artist was always a complete badass in her own career. The success of her mid-'00s makeup blog turned into a writing gig for MTV Style, a YouTube series with Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, and eventually her own business called Silk Parlor.</p><p>As for her personal life, folks are wondering â€” especially considering the media has extensively covered <a href=#>John's relationship (and marriage) with Olivia Munn</a> â€” who is Anna Marie dating these days?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@nicholasttrain</a><p>Nicholas Tran</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Anna Marie Tendler dating?</h2><p>In February 2023, reports emerged that Anna Marie was dating a chef named Nicholas Tran, who has been hailed as a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">culinary virtuoso</a>." He launched a dining experience in New York called The Dark Room, where eight guests at a time are served his Asian-inspired dishes in Nicholas's own apartment kitchen.</p><p>And Nicholas has certainly come a long way in his career, with a lot of work to show for it. As his bio on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetResident.com</a> reads: "After taking a job as a dishwasher, Nicholas fell in love with the culinary world, hence moving up the ladder and perfecting his craft as he continued to cook around the world at acclaimed restaurants such as Quince (3 Michelin Stars) and Cotogna in San Francisco and Gramercy Tavern (1 Michelin Star) and Kappo Masa in New York."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Katie | NYC FoodieðŸ¥¢ (@thebellychronicles)</a></p></figure><p>If you're looking to snag your own seat at The Dark Room, good luck. But if you do, you'll be in for a heck of a time. Not only is Nicholas's food influenced by both his culinary experiences in Japan and Italy, but you'll also potentially be in great company while you enjoy your delicious cuisine. "One time there was an opera singer who performed a song, another time there was a magician who did a few card tricks," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelin Guide</a> of some of his guests.</p><p>Anyhoo, we hope Anna Marie is truly living her best life, whatever her relationship status may be. We can't wait to read <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her memoir</a>, and we also can't wait to see what she does next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruvrYymmKuhlWLBprrDpZyrZZSWwaq6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
