Here's what she sent: "Good morning, good morning! It's your mommy! Don't get pregnant! I'm too young to be a nana. I love you!"</p><p>A little while later, Fiona's daughter responded with her own announcement, asking her mom to cut it out.

Clean your bedroom!" Fiona, assuming her daughter had disconnected the device, didn't anticipate a response. To her surprise, a few moments later, her daughter replied, "OK, you can stop now."</p><p>Ignoring her mom's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third announcement</a>, the college student couldn't resist the fourth. When Fiona <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned</a> if she was already asleep (considering the time difference), her daughter bluntly shot back, "F--- off!"</p><p>Fiona's daughter continued her selective hearing streak, ignoring the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fifth announcement</a>: "Good morning!
