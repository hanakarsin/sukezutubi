This is why I don’t support the call for the release of Igboho.</p><p>“I am sure he must be regretting his actions now. Any Nigerian can live in any part of the country and I have always said that there are criminals everywhere. There are criminals among Yoruba just like we have among the Fulani people. This is where we expected the government to come in and fish out those who are criminally minded.”</p><p>He further stated that he hopes he would get justice and compensation for the properties that were destroyed during his eviction from Igangan.</p><p>Igboho is currently in detention in the Benin Republic since his arrest at Cardinal Bernardin International Airport, Cotonou, while on his way to Germany in July 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FrZqydop64qnnFrqOappliv6bCxJqjrGWnncZutMRmrpqmpKh6tMHNnZiyZZmcr7C0zmagp2Walratew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
