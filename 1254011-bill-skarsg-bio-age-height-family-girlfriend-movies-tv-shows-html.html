In a Bill Skarsgård interview, he revealed that he developed the Pennywise smile at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tender age of 10</a> years. He further explained that his elder brother Gustaf would point his lip in a very strange way and he copied him, just like siblings copy each other. He would then make a weird face, pull a t-shirt over his head and terrify his younger brother. The Bill Skarsgård Pennywise smile was thus not developed when shooting the movie but was something that he had practiced way before he began his acting career. Bill Skarsgård smile is very freaky and scary though in a thrilling way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b9beff555c0a88d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gad Elmaleh biography: Partners, son, religion, net worth, movies</span></p></a><h2>Bill Skarsgård girlfriend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1755959d13bfb307.jpg><p class=align-left>Bill Skarsgård started dating his Swedish actress girlfriend, Alida Morberg from 2016.
