In that time, it went from a quiet show about the triumphs and pitfalls of a family with three little people in it to one that showcased a divorce, a family member becoming slightly estranged, weddings, and births. After all this time, it's hard not to wonder what the Roloff Farm is worth.</p><p>Although Amy Roloff sold her half of the farm to her ex-husband, Matt Roloff still owns the farm, and pumpkin season is likely a bigger hit than ever, thanks to the show's continued popularity. Some of their kids are also still heavily ingrained in taking care of the family farm. Chances are, the farm is still worth a pretty penny, even after all these years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How much is the Roloff Farm worth?</h2><p>Although the Roloff Farm isn't on the market, according to Zillow, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>it was assessed at $1,657,830</u></a> in 2018. Not only is the farm used for the annual pumpkin patch, which draws thousands of customers from all over, but people can also get private tours of the place and visit the on-site store. It all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>started on 34 acres</u></a> and transformed into 100 acres of farmland, specially built structures, and an impressive main house.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Matt Roloff’s net worth is an indication of the farm’s success.</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matt’s net worth is $4.5 million</u></a>. While he makes some money from Little People, Big World, he once worked as a computer programmer and he was in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Star Wars</u><u> TV movie</u></a> Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. Not bad for a guy who ended up building a farm from the ground up. And now that Amy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sold her half</u></a> of the farm to him, he has even more responsibilities in running the place.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I realize it’s difficult to believe a guy in a bright red hat .... but please don’t believe all the click-bait news headlines — you know .. the ones where the double quotes are all mixed around... get the Un-edited words directly from my mouth to your ears @firstclassfatherhood ... @alec_lace just let me know that the recent podcast was one of his most popular.

News that most reality <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TV families earn 10 percent</u></a> of the show’s income. He also revealed that TLC likely budgets $250,000 to $400,000 per episode for its reality shows with families, which includes Little People, Big World. If that’s the case, then the Roloff family could be raking in $25,000 to $40,000 per episode, which would then be distributed among the key family members and, potentially, their spouses. They could be on the higher end, however.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There were rumors of the Roloffs selling the farm.</h2><p>When previews for Little People, Big World Season 19 hinted at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matt and Amy selling the farm</u></a> in 2019, fans were worried what that meant for the fate of the show. At the time, the trailer hinted at Matt and Amy considering parting ways with the farm since they had ended their marriage. In the end, they didn't sell the farm and instead, Amy sold her half to Matt so she could start over.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Through it all, the Roloff Farm has remained important on the show and a centerpiece for the family, especially as it continues to expand. As to be expected, the farm is worth a lot and, chances are, its value will only continue to grow.</p><p>Watch Little People, Big World on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFlmah6tbTEZqmopJ%2Bbs26ywKukZq%2Bfp8Gp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
