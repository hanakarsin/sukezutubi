However, sources close to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sportster</a> revealed this was not the case.

"Nothing can prepare you for this news after getting a positive pregnancy test. I was cautiously optimistic this time around after the early loss I had already experienced but was hoping for the best."</p><p>"I’m part of this statistic and it’s happening to me. ... I know I’ll eventually recover from all of this mentally, physically, and emotionally," Carmella concluded. "For anyone dealing with ANY type of pregnancy loss, I want you to know your feelings and emotions are valid, there is NOTHING wrong with you and you are not alone."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leah Van Dale (@carmellawwe)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In May 2023, Carmella shared that she and her husband are having a baby!</h2><p>On May 1, 2023, the WWE Superstar announced on Good Morning America that she was pregnant. "It's just all been such a whirlwind," she said. "I think because of my past, it was hard to get excited off the bat about this one, but I was cautiously optimistic. I try to have a good mindset, a positive mindset this time around, and it's working. So I'm very happy about that."</p><p>"I've been nauseous. I've been so tired, more tired than I've ever been in my life," she continued. "But I've never been so happy to feel so awful. I've been great, I mean mentally. It's kind of this weird space where I'm excited, but also just a little apprehensive because of the miscarriages. It's unfortunate that it robs you of the true excitement that should be there."</p><p>Carmella shared that she is due in November of 2023.
