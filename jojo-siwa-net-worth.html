She’s best known for being a talented dancer – something the world was able to take note of during her time on Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition. She competed against other skilled dancers, but never crumbled against her competition. She didn’t need to stay on any dancing shows for long though! Her infectious personality was enough to snag her some national attention.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>JoJo Siwa</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Dancer, singer, and YouTube personality</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $20 million</p><p>JoJo Siwa is a dancer, singer, and YouTube personality.</p><p><strong>Birth name: </strong>Joelle Joanie Siwa</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>May 19, 2003</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Omaha, Neb.</p><p>From there, she was able to begin shaping and molding her career in the way she wanted. Reality TV is a great way for people to become popular with audiences and this route obviously worked very well for JoJo. She was easy to root for during her time on the dance-centered shows because of her outspoken attitude and incredible ability to follow tough choreography. Establishing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> was a natural next step for the starlet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JoJo Siwa (@itsjojosiwa)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @itsjojosiwa</span></figure><p>She's amassed over 12.2 million subscribers since posting her first piece of content. A quick scroll through her YouTube channel proves that JoJo knows what she's doing! She posts the exact content her followers want to see, seeing as each of her videos pulls in millions of views on average. Another brilliant business move for JoJo was her idea to sell colorful bows. She's sold over 40 million bow ribbons to her fans, and a 14-pack of bows goes for almost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 on Amazon</a>.</p><p>The financial milestones she's reached for selling bows alone are impressive. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, JoJo has a net worth of $20 million. At the start of 2020, JoJo invested $3.5 million into a dreamy Los Angeles home in the suburbs of Tarzana, Calif.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jessalynn Siwa (@jessalynnsiwa)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @jessalynnsiwa</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about JoJo Siwa's mom?</h2><p>JoJo's mom is named <a href=#>Jessalynn </a><a href=#>Siwa</a>.
