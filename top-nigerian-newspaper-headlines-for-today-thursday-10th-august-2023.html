Sheikh Abduurrahman; Sheikh Bala Lau and Sheikh Qaribulahi Nasir Ksbara.</p><p>The former secretary to the government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha has revealed that ex-president, Muhammadu Buhari once contemplated choosing Senator Adeleke Olurunnimbe Mamora as his vice-presidential candidate.</p><p>Speaking at a dinner in Abuja, hosted by the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) led by Mr. Akinbode Oluwafemi, Mustapha said that Mamora was highly valued by Buhari during his time in the federal executive council.</p><p>According to The Guardian, Mustapha, however, did not make clear whether Buhari’s consideration of Mamora was before his second term or during the 2015 election preparations.</p><p>There were claims that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, reportedly proposed Prof Yemi Osinbajo for the vice-president role.</p><p>Highlighting Buhari’s trust in Mamora, Mustapha noted Buhari’s appointments for Mamora, including as Minister of Science and Technology and previously as Minister of State for Health.</p><p>World Trade Organisation’s Director-General, Professor Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has denied reports alleging she was attacked for visiting Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu.</p><p>Naija News reports that Ngozi alongside former Minister of State for Health under Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, Dr. Ali Pate visited Tinubu on Tuesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p><p>Okonjo-Iweala was the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy during Jonathan’s government.</p><p>Following the visit, reports alleging that the former finance minister was attacked circulated social media space.</p><p>Debunking the reports, Ngozi via her Twitter handle on Wednesday urged Nigerians to disregard such reports as it is wicked and false to create mischief amongs Nigerians.</p><p>The Vice President of Nigeria, Senator Kashim Shettima on Wednesday, inaugurated the reconstituted board and management of the North East Development Commission (NEDC).</p><p>The inauguration was done on Wednesday, Naija News reports.</p><p>According to a statement by the Director of Information in Office of the Vice President, Olusola Abiola, Shettima urged members of the newly-reconstituted board to focus on human capital development.</p><p>The Vice President stressed that the constitution of the board is beyond a political jamboree but is a testimony of the commitment of the President Bola Tinubu administration to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region.</p><p>Shettima commended the efforts of the immediate past board, but stressed the need for the new members to work to restore the glory of the region.</p><p>The Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Tax Policy and Fiscal Reforms, Taiwo Oyedele, has pushed for the suspension of Value Added Tax (VAT) on Automotive Gas Oil also known as diesel.</p><p>According to him, suspension of VAT on diesel will be a way to cushion the harsh economic effects of the removal of fuel subsidy by the President Bola Tinubu administration.</p><p>Speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Wednesday, Naija News gathered that Oyedele noted that even though he is not promising it will be done, the issue will be tabled before the committee because it seeks to achieve some landmark things in the first 30 days.</p><p>This platform recalls that the President on Tuesday inaugurated the committee with the mandate of working on fiscal governance, tax reforms, and growth facilitation.</p><p>Ousted Niger Republic President, Mohamed Bazoum, on Wednesday, disclosed he’s been isolated and forced to survive on dry rice since the military’s takeover on July 26, 2023.</p><p>In text messages shared with a friend and cited by CNN, Bazoum mentioned being “deprived of all human contact” and left without food or medicine.</p><p>He has also been without electricity, an issue plaguing all Nigeriens due to Nigeria’s response to the coup by cutting power.</p><p>Although he’s largely cut off, Bazoum has managed some outside communication. He confirmed speaking with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken by phone, despite missing a chance to meet the visiting Deputy Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland.</p><p>The Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), President Bola Tinubu has called for a meeting following the expiration of the bloc’s 7-day ultimatum for Bazoum’s reinstatement.</p><p>The former Emir of Kano, Mohammad Sanusi on Wednesday met with President Bola Tinubu at the Presidential Villa.</p><p>Naija News had earlier reported that Sanusi met with President Tinubu to brief him on his meeting with the military coup leaders in Niger.</p><p>Sanusi while addressing newsmen after the meeting said he came to the Presidential Villa to brief President Tinubu on his discussions with the leaders of military junta that overthrew the democratically elected government.</p><p>The former Emir when asked to speak on the reports that he took the initiative by himself and not the government’s delegation said, “No, I was not sent by the government. Government officials were aware I was going, but it was my personal initiative, using my personal contacts to get there and I will continue to do my best. It is my duty as a leader to do that.”</p><p>He said that he was well received by the military juntas in Niger.</p><p>A retired Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Peter-Odili has distanced herself from an allegation that she is influencing judges of the court of appeal and the Supreme Court to ensure that President Bola Tinubu gets a favourable judgment at the Presidential election petition tribunal.</p><p>Naija News understands that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, flagbearer of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi and the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) are challenging Tinubu’s victory in the presidential election held on the 25th of February, 2023.</p><p>A Twitter user, Jackson Ude had alleged that Peter-Odili is helping Tinubu secure a favourable judgement at the tribunal.</p><p>Reacting to the allegation in a press statement signed by her spokesperson, Felix Enebeli, Odili described the claim as “false and malicious”.</p><p>Enebeli added that Odili’s lawyers are on the issue and have demanded a retraction and public apology from Ude.</p><p>According to Enebeli, a redress would be sought in court if Ude failed to retract the story.</p><p>The National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) has verified the legitimacy of the certificate presented by Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, a ministerial nominee of President Bola Tinubu, to the Nigerian Senate.</p><p>An investigation by Premium Times found inconsistencies with Tunji-Ojo’s NYSC certificate.</p><p>Though he claimed to have served from November 2019 to November 2020, his certificate was issued in February and signed by Yushau Ahmed, who only took office as NYSC Director-General in January.</p><p>This raised eyebrows as NYSC traditionally provides certificates immediately post-service and doesn’t reprint them.</p><p>Despite these discrepancies, the Nigerian Senate approved Tunji-Ojo’s ministerial nomination.</p><p>Seeking clarity, the platform filed a Freedom of Information request with the NYSC, questioning the certificate’s issuance date and the circumstances of Tunji-Ojo’s NYSC mobilization while serving in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Former Governor of Katsina State, Nasir El-Rufai, is reportedly set to reject the ministerial appointment from President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p><p>Recall that President Tinubu had sent the names of El-Rufai and 47 others to the National Assembly for screening and confirmation as ministers.</p><p>However, the former Kaduna governor and Stella Okotete were not cleared by the Senate due to allegations levelled against them, while Umar Danladi was not cleared because of a Supreme Court ruling barring him from holding office for ten years.</p><p>It is understood that El-Rufai and the other two nominees would have to get security clearance before they are called back to the Senate for confirmation.</p><p>But according to Peoples Gazette, El-Rufai will turn down the ministerial appointment even if his security clearance ultimately goes through for Senate confirmation.</p><p>Sources told the news platform that El-Rufai was angry by the hold on his senatorial screening and confirmation that appeared to cast a shadow on his security status as a prominent Nigerian politician.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
