The staff at the organization focuses on taking underserved kids out for a meal tour, and providing assistance with both their mental and physical health.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>He got the idea for ABC Food Tours when he met a group of elementary school kids after grabbing a meal in the area. Matt subsequently reached out to the kids' school principal, and he learned that half of the students at the school were homeless.</p><p>While ABC Food Tours is primarily focused on kids in the Alphabet City area (the Lower East Side of Manhattan), Matt has goals to expand into other boroughs of New York City.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Matt James?</h2><p>The 28-year-old was born and raised in Raleigh, N.C. Both Matt and Tyler played football at Wake Forest University (Tyler later transferred to Florida Atlantic University), where they became close friends. While he was at Wake Forest, Matt first became involved in volunteering and giving back through food tours.&nbsp;</p><p>When he graduated in 2015, Matt had aspirations to play professional football. He was drafted to the Carolina Panthers, and later to the New Orleans Saints, but he was ultimately cut from both teams in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>He put his economics degree to good use with a job at a bank in Pittsburgh, and he later worked as an analyst at a New York real estate company.
