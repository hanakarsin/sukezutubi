Normally, when you open a message, the person who sent it can see that you've looked at it, but the half-swipe was a convenient way for particularly crafty users to get around this problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This half-swipe method required that you only open a message partway, and could allow users to choose whether to reply to a message without telling the person who sent it that they'd seen it. In <a href=#>June of last year,</a> though, Snapchat changed the feature so that the sender would be notified even if a user opened a message using the half-swipe method. Although the change was made some time ago, some users are just realizing that it happened more recently.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some users want the half-swipe method to make a comeback.</h2><p>Even as Snapchat users have begun to realize that the app has made the half-swipe pointless, many have begun to pray that the accidental bug would make a return to the app.</p><p>“Wait, is snap really sending notifications when people half swipe your chat?” one person tweeted.</p><p>“This is my request for Snapchat to remove the half-swipe facility for everyone except me because frankly, it’s one of the things that p--s me off the most” another added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The change clearly has people riled up, but it seems unlikely that Snapchat would roll it back. After all, the half-swipe was always a bug as opposed to a feature that Snapchat had intentionally designed into the app. From their perspective, this change was more like a fix than a revamping of one of Snapchat's key features. They clearly want users who send messages to know when the receiver has read them, even if that can sometimes get awkward.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wish you could half-swipe Snapchat pictures</p>— Vicenarian Steve (@ConorMouldOk) <a href=#>June 12, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The exact reasons why Snapchat wanted to avoid allowing receivers to see messages without notifying the sender are not totally clear, but it seems like even those who love the half-swipe are not preparing to leave Snapchat as a result of the change.</p><p>In a world where social media companies control how users navigate through their apps, Snapchat was just closing a loophole.</p><p>Even as they fixed that particular bug, though, Snapchat has worked like other social media companies to introduce new features that keep you hooked on the app. You can create your own <a href=#>geofilters</a> or <a href=#>use a poll </a>to interact with friends. The half-swipe may be gone, but that doesn't mean Snapchat doesn't want you spending time on the app.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaZXZ2urbKMrK6iqJVivK950qeYqZuYlsE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
