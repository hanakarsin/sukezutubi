Season 6 of the TLC reality series broke ratings records as it followed some controversial couples such as <a href=#>Colt and Larissa</a> and <a href=#>Ashley and Jay</a> — and fans are already asking for more.&nbsp;</p><p>"When does 90 Day Fiancé come back I need something to live for," one die-hard tweeted before another added, "I’m already missing my #90DayFiance fix... I guess i will have to fill the void with the new season of #SisterWives & #SeekingSisterWife."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, when does 90 Day Fiancé return?</h2><p>TLC has not announced an official date, but the show was just renewed for a Season 7. "It is so exciting that, after six seasons, the tried and true original&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé is captivating more viewers than ever," President and General Manager of TLC, Howard Lee, said per Deadline. "From laughter to tears to a ticking clock, TLC is dedicated to giving our viewers a rollercoaster of emotions with&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé — and we’re just getting started."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, viewers might have to wait longer for a new season since it is being reported that the ongoing government shut down may delay filming. In case you forgot, the show follows foreign fiancés who come to the United States on a K-1 and have 90 days to decide whether they want to get married — and if the government is not running, there are no visas to hand out.&nbsp;</p><p>"It could cause significant delays in visa processing, and it’s going to be a new challenge for reality producers looking to cast the upcoming seventh season," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. "The casting process is going on right now. In a sense, it’s holding up production, because without a locked-down cast, we can’t film."&nbsp;</p><p>The insider continued, "The stories are contingent on a good cast, so it’s harder to find available couples, because it’s following people who have already been approved. The wait is longer."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the 90 Day Fiancé success rate?&nbsp;</h2><p>Surprisingly, the show is pretty successful at finding couples who are really in love. "Our batting average on this show is that out of every 25 couples on 90 Day Fiancé,&nbsp;we’ve only had three divorces," Matt Sharp, CEO of Sharp Entertainment , said before Season 6 aired. "That’s less than 10 percent and the current U.S. (divorce) rate is over 40 percent. It’s one&nbsp;of the reasons why people love this show, it’s so unexpected."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, that divorce rate is about to increase. Out of the six couples featured on the series this past year, only three are still together —&nbsp;<a href=#>Eric and Leida</a>, Asuelu and Kalani, and <a href=#>Olga and Steven</a>.</p><p>Colt Johnson just <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Larissa Dos Santos Lima (who was arrested for the third time since moving from Brazil), Ashley Martson also filed for divorce from Jay Smith after just eight months of marriage, and <a href=#>Jonathan Rivera and Fernanda Flores</a> have split as well.&nbsp;</p><p>"She wanted to pursue a modeling career in Chicago. Decided to leave and realized she couldn’t do it on her own," Jonathan said of his recent split with Fernanda. "She said MANY things you can’t take back that I won’t mention, you’ll have to trust me when I tell you, good luck."</p><p>Sigh... who's ready for Season 7?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9ngnCbqW%2BoamqFoqZww8eepWacn5rAboWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5kq52kqr%2Bv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
