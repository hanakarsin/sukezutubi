What if his utterance is only an early stage in a larger plan? Threats to this country should not be taken as a joke.”</p><p>Tofa, a former National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate in Nigeria’s June 12, 1993, presidential election,&nbsp; also described zoning the 2023 presidential ticket as detrimental to the unity of the country.</p><p>“It is the sign of backwardness to continue propagating a divisive presidency, rather than the one that will serve all Nigerians equally and justly,” adding that “the blame for this backwardness was on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),”</p><p>“The PDP started this foolish idea. They have damaged the political climate of this country while thinking it was for the best. Now it has become what may destroy this country if care is not taken,” he said.</p><p>Tofa stated that Nigeria “is now too polarised for the Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian ticket to be dared by any party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FqZp%2BfXaLCtMCMrZiknV2WwKK%2ByGabqKOll7xuv8SroKito6HGbq7ArJ%2Biql2pvKetjLCYq6ajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
