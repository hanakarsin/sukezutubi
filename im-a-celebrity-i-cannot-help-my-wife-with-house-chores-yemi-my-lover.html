He however stated that he helped his wife in planting crops such as yams and vegetables so she wouldn’t go far to purchase them.</p><p>He also said that he could not go to the market and buy stuff for his wife because he is a celebrity and thugs might try to harm him if he is seen in the market.</p><p>He said: “In the family, I come from, it’s not permitted.</p><p>“How can I be helping my wife with chores? For what? The only thing I did was that I plant vegetables behind the house because I like greens. I water them in the morning and night. I also planted yam and pepper. At least, with that, I believe that I have supported her so that she wouldn’t have to go far before getting some of these items.</p><p>“I am a celebrity, so, they need to treat me as a king; someone that has a name is like a king. Just like when you asked me if I assist with chores, someone that is a celebrity should not be the one going to the market and all that. People will then see me in the market and be saying, ‘Look, the celebrity came to buy something in the market,’ and before you blink, the area boys would have invaded me.”</p><p>Sharing his thoughts on whether women should help men financially in the home, he argued that it is the job of a woman to assist her husband while also citing women abroad who make it a point of duty to help out their spouse money-wise.</p><p>He said: “That’s what they (women) are meant for. They are supposed to support their husbands in every aspect. You know what the Yoruba mean by oluranlowo (helper)? It’s a helper. The way it is abroad, when the bills are brought, the wife, who is also working, doesn’t expect the husband to pay everything while she keeps her money.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BqZqKlXZZ6pLHLnpmroaSueqp5wpqlp6ekYrWmuM9mpLJlp56zpnnWoquhZZikwrSxjJyfqKqVqHq6scyiZKaxXaG8t7HRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
