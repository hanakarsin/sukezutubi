The couple got engaged in May 2018 in Waikiki, where — according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a> — Chumlee proposed with a 1.5-karat diamond ring. They held a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-wedding party</a> in March of the following year, and reportedly tied the knot in Hawaii that May.</p><p>"It’s beautiful. I already feel like I’m married," Chumlee said to the Review-Journal the day after the pre-wedding party. "We were friends for a year or two before we were ever a couple."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the time that they've been together, Olivia has seemingly supported Chumlee amidst a flurry of legal issues, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 felony counts of drug and gun violations</a>, that resulted in a term of three years' probation. However, it seems like Olivia may no longer be by her husband's side.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Chumlee and his wife get divorced?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, neither Chumlee nor Olivia has publicly commented on the status of their marriage, but their social media feeds seem to be quite telling. Up until a couple years ago, Chumlee regularly posted photos of his wife on Instagram — but in 2020, he chose to delete them all, leaving many to wonder if they're still together.</p><p>His Facebook still features photos of Olivia, however the most recent appears to be from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trip to the Bahamas in March 2019</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>You also won't find a single photo of Chumlee on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia's Instagram</a>. In fact, all photos prior to January 2020 have since been deleted. What her feed does show, however, are recent images of her cuddling up to 32-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">professional poker player</a> Jake Schindler. Images show them out on the town in Las Vegas and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">traveling through Rome</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened between Chumlee and Olivia?</h2><p>With no official comment from either party, it's hard to say what exactly happened between the couple. However, it seems like distance may have played a factor in the rumored dissolution of their marriage.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a since-deleted Instagram post from October 2019 (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNetline</a>), Chumlee complained about living apart from Olivia: "Missing my wife, it’s hard living apart," he reportedly wrote. "She is off preparing for our future, going to school at USCB, while I am in Las Vegas working and it’s the little things I miss, like waking up next to her or hav[ing] dinner together. But knowing we get to spend the rest of our lives together ... is enough to make me happy.”</p><p>Unfortunately, it looks like things may not have gone the way that Chumlee hoped, but we wish him and Olivia all the happiness moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLW2ucuenGaokay7br%2FTmqmsZaees6Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
