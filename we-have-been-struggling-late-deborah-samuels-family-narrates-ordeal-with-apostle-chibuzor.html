He paid the rent. Right now, the rent for this apartment has expired. The landlord has told us to renew the rent or leave.</p><p>“All the appliances and the equipment in this apartment belong to OPM, we don’t own it. The first time OPM brought us to Port Harcourt they brought food items to us. After that first time, we have been struggling on our own.</p><p>“OPM got me a car. It was a Toyota Corolla, but it wasn’t new. It was a fairly used vehicle and the car has developed some faults. I was using it as a taxi before but it has some challenges and I have parked it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Right from the day OPM gave me this car, the car has been developing faults. On the first day I tried to take my children to school the car broke down on its way back. We towed the car back.”</p><p>Also speaking, the late Deborah’s mother, Alheri, recalled some of the experiences they had in Niger State with some Christians but not the same with members of OPM.</p><p>She said, “I really wanted to return to Niger State because there is no support here. It isn’t about money, no member of OPM comes here to pay us a visit. Since we’ve been in Port Harcourt, none of OPM’s members cared enough to visit us here. While we were in Niger we were surrounded by loved ones and Christians from different churches.</p><p>“We just leave everything in the hands of God. I thank everyone who has tried to help us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5ByZrCdXZ2ut7GMm5yepl2owbPBxqCjoqaXYrmiwMRmm56an6euqXnSmqSunZyoeqetzKKjsmWelr%2BzrdOeqmanopmyoriMsKCtoF2WvbC%2F06WcZpuYnq%2B2xs6rZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
