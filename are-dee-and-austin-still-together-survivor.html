After watching Dee's showmance with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Li Coon</a> blossom over the course of the final few episodes, we want to know the latest!</p><p>We’ve now seen intimate chats on the beach, comparing themselves to <a href=#>Rob and Amber from Survivor: All-Stars</a>, and they’ve even had a romantic date on a sandbar (with Katurah as a third wheel). Now that Austin and Dee are back stateside, what's the status of their relationship? They both seemed to be pretty into their showmance and both claimed that their feelings were 100 percent real (and not just game strategy). So, are they still together?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Austin and Dee from 'Survivor' still together?</h2><p>The Reba Four were dominating Survivor 45 until Drew decided to target Julie Alley. However, Drew and Austin’s plan got back to Julie when Austin decided to tell Dee, which changed the trajectory of the game. Dee told Julie and the two of them worked together to blindside Emily. Austin assumed that Julie had found out about the plan from someone else, but during Final Tribal Council, Dee fessed up.</p><p>Dee managed to blindside Austin a second time in Episode 12 when the girls and Jake took out Drew. Once again, Dee chose not to fill Austin in on the plan — and he admitted later that if she had, he would have given Drew his amulet in order to save him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>With all of these strategic decisions, we wouldn't blame either Austin or Dee for chalking their showmance up to just something that happened during filming and wasn't meant to last forever. However, during the finale, they still seemed to be very into the idea of pursuing something once the cameras stopped rolling.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dee confirmed that her relationship with Austin continued after the show — but not whether they're still together.</h2><p>In the post-finale episode of the official Survivor podcast On Fire, Jeff asked Dee to comment on the status of her relationship with Austin. She didn't give too many details but did confirm that she and Austin's relationship continued after the cameras stopped rolling:</p><p>Jeff: Was this ultimately a showmance or did it continue?</p><p>Dee: It was both! It was a showmance and it did continue. Once we can finally post, you’re gonna see a lot of pictures of us on vacation.</p><p>Jeff: So does that mean you’re still together?</p><p>Dee: it means we are taking things slow because he lives in Chicago and I’m in Miami. So we're taking it slow. That’s my answer, my final answer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>It should also be noted that Dee currently follows at least two of Austin's family members on Instagram (in addition to following Austin himself). Even if they're not currently together, there's no denying that they had a ton of fun flirting on national television!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecOenGaZnpl6osHSraCnZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzedKuqa%2BhpqS%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
