Humans are naturally wired to look for humour, regardless of kind, and dark comedy is one of the most dominant. So, what are the effects of a dark sense of humor in psychology, and does it have any negative impacts?</p><h2>What is a dark sense of humor?</h2><p class=align-left>What does dark sense of humor mean? Are individuals that find dark humour psychotic? Is dark comedy funny or offensive? These are some of the questions that surround the hardly understood humour that make certain individuals seem weird.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d35390401e3bd6fb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best anti-jokes for those who have a dry sense of humour</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dark humour's meaning can vary from person to person. It is a comic style that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">makes light of subjects</a> that are generally considered taboo. In certain instances, these subject matters are regarded as serious or painful to discuss. Some people might refer it to as jokes about life that are expressed in a distressing manner.</p><p class=align-left>The perception of humour or something you find amusing is quite vague if you think about it. There isn't a formula written down defining something funny. Therefore, it is upon a person to make sense of what they consider funny. And this element makes humour one of the most complicated subjects.</p><p class=align-left>Movies and TV shows perfectly depict dark humour. You have likely watched some of these productions and wondered how the characters joke about violence, war or disease. This is a classic example of dark humour, and you've likely laughed at such instances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3780b168bf2d668.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ inspirational nature status to caption photos of plants and animals</span></p></a><h2>Common topics for dark humour</h2><p class=align-left>For dark humour to be effective, the subject has to be dark, of course. However, satire can provoke <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">serious discussions</a> about topics that people might not desire to talk about in certain instances. So, what are the common subjects that relate to dark humour?</p><ul><li>War and terrorism.</li><li>Murder, violence, death.</li><li>Political corruption.</li><li>Human sexuality.</li><li>Racial or sexual stereotypes.</li><li>Poverty, disease, and famine.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The idea behind dark humour is to take the worst of humanity and make it funny. That is why a dark sense of humor is not for everyone, as such matters are often left undiscussed.</p><h2>The history of black comedy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d35390401e3bd6fb.jpg><p class=align-left>The most interesting thing is that the term black humour didn’t technically originate until 1935. During this time, Surrealist theorist Andre Breton was interpreting the works of Jonathan Swift, who is recognised for his essay, <i>A Modest Proposal</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63b15ebacc9cf685.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ weird quotes that make no sense at all but are funny</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The public got wind of dark humour in 1965 when a book called <i>Black Humor </i>was published and distributed in the marketplace. The book is purely dedicated to dark comedy.</p><h2>Is dark humor offensive?</h2><p class=align-left>The idea of dark comedy is controversial, especially considering its subjects are often disputed. But, today, the sense of humour is common with high profile <a href=#>comics</a> on stage and social media platforms. It can bring people together while at the same time put them apart.</p><p class=align-left>Although laughter has numerous physical benefits, there is a thin line between a harmless joke and what someone might consider an insensitive comment.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, dark humour can be offensive if it brushes someone the wrong way. After all, it creates comedy from topics that are ordinarily considered taboo to talk about. This way, people using dark humour ought to be careful not to sound blatantly disrespectful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 books that make you think about love in a different way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>People making jokes that they consider dark humour ought to consider certain things before posting them on social media.</p><ul><li>Can the user draw from personal experiences?</li><li>Have you checked with the person or group of people if it is directly relating to them?</li></ul><p class=align-left>A fantastic way to judge whether the dark comedy is insulting is to determine if you can make the same comment in front of those you are describing. If you cannot, it is offensive and shouldn't be created in the first instance.</p><h2>Dark sense of humor and intelligence</h2><p class=align-left>If you laugh at dark jokes, you are likely not evil but intelligent.
