I’m thankful for everyone I’ve journeyed with and continue to learn and grow." Preach, girl!&nbsp;</p><p>However, as fans continued to question if her posts were about her “reported ex,” Leah finally set the record on her relationship straight. She tweeted: “Just to be very clear, Nothing that I post is in reference to my recent break up or Jason! I wish him the best!!!!” Ouch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why did Leah and Jason break up?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This is certainly not the first time the two decided to end their relationship. Before the holidays, the MTV starlet said goodbye to her 40-year-old beau.</p><p>“It just wasn’t working,” a source told Us at the time. “They’re just not a good fit.”&nbsp;</p><p>The reality star also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HollywoodLife.com</u></a> that her ex-beau was not in the right mindset to be in a committed relationship, saying, "He wasn’t in a great place in his life, and it is what it is.

The former couple initially met through Jordan’s cousin and were reportedly “getting serious” last July. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“They share the same faith and have gone to church together,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. And their 14-year age difference was seemingly not a negative factor in their relationship, the source cited, claiming: “Even though he’s older, they have a lot of common. They love hiking, cooking and are both very family oriented. He’s very attentive.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the couple decided to part ways, we can’t rule out a possible reunion. In Teen Mom world, you certainly never know what ex will pop back up on our TV screens. &nbsp;</p><p>For now, with her ex in her rearview mirror, Leah seems to be finding comfort with her daughters — &nbsp;Aliannah and Aleeah, 9, and Adalynn, 6. She recently posted a gorgeous Instagram pic of herself with the three girls, which she captioned, "They will forever be my reasoning for a successful and abundantly joyful simple LIFE! Everything I do, I do it for them."</p><p>&nbsp;Watch new episodes of Teen Mom 2 on Mondays at 9 p.m ET on MTV. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aklZa1bq3NnWSjmaOku26u0Z6YpGWlpXq1scSnZKannWJ%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
