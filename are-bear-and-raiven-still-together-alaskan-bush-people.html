They both gushed to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> People</a> at the time about how over-the-moon they were to be married.</p><p>"It feels really good to be a married man, I've loved Raiven a long time and it's a honor and a privilege to finally call her my wife," Bear gushed. "She is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and still takes my breath away! I only wish Da [his deceased father, <strong>Billy Brown</strong>] had been there, but I know he was watching from the best seat! I look forward to building a life, a family and a home with Raiven, she's the love of my life and my heart belongs to her and her alone.”</p><p>The bride agreed, adding, "Was so very happy to have our friends and family that were able to make it.

Raiven was named as the victim was in this arrest, and it was documented by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> that one of her family members made the call. When police arrived on the scene they noticed a visible scratch on Raiven.</p><p>Bear took a plea deal back in May – which including surrendering his firearms, $270 in fines, avoid arrest and be sure to alert the courts in any change of address, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the outlet</a>.</p><p>Raiven spoke out about the incident at the time via Instagram stories, stating, “I appreciate people being supportive and reaching out. That being said, I do not have anything to share publicly. I want the best for my family and I hope that this ends in my family’s best interest.
