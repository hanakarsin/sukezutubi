Amid his own marital issues, Miguel was a confidante to Jack when things went left with Rebecca.</p><p>The two were best buds up until Jack’s death — which left Miguel and Rebecca in shambles. Before long, the two developed a bond, and their grief only brought them closer together.</p><p>According to Jon Huertas, Season 6 will explore Miguel’s story in-depth, including his childhood. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>, Jon opened up about “Miguel’s Past” and shared what viewers can expect to learn about his character in the upcoming episode.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Yael Ocasio as Miguel and Javier Molina as Risto</p></figure><p>“I’m really happy about this episode because it’s diving deep into Miguel’s history. It’s going way back. There’s a lot of authenticity in this episode,” Jon explained. “I was able to share a lot of emotional footnotes in my life to help tell Miguel’s story.”</p><p>In the episode, we’ll also meet Miguel’s family. Jon said that he encouraged showrunners to hire Puerto Rican actors who “[helped] honor the truth” of who Miguel is “as a person.”</p><p>Jon confirmed that viewers will also meet a younger version of Miguel. The This Is Us actor teased, “He’ll be much younger.
