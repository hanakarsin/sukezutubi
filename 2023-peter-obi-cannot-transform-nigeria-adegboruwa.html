Buhari even presented a ‘progressive’ manifesto to us with fantastic promises only to turn around to disown it after his election.</p><p>“Obi has jumped from the All Progressive Grand Alliance which gave him the platform to be governor, to the PDP, and now to the Labour Party. With Nigeria’s current structure, a million Obi will end up worse than Buhari.</p><p>“There is an urgent need to restructure Nigeria and if we keep recycling politicians every four years, there will be nothing for the masses except lamentations. The 1999 Constitution of Nigeria is itself the enemy of our development and progress.</p><p>“It is time to discard it and enact a new Constitution that will reflect the will of the people, instead of jumping around with politicians every four years with no mission in focus. That is the 2023 dilemma. Restructuring is the answer, after all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5ByZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeeqStzaemrWWkp66vv8WoqaZlnp60pr7ImmSanJWcr7C%2B1LCYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
