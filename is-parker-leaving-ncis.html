There’s no indication that Agent Alden Parker is leaving NCIS anytime soon. In fact, Season 19 of NCIS takes viewers on a trip down memory lane to get a better understanding of his backstory.</p><p>In the Feb. 13 episode — entitled “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Wounds</a>” — Parker got closure on an unsolved case. But he didn’t do it without breaking protocol.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Parker and his ex-partner Jeremy Brighton (<a href=#>Michael Patrick Thorton</a>) were reunited after an old foe came out of hiding.</p><p>The suspect in question was responsible for paralyzing Brighton during a drug raid, and Parker wanted revenge by any means necessary. Unfortunately, those means got him pretty much thrown off the case.</p><p>It’s unclear whether or not Parker will face additional consequences for his actions, but we know he’ll be back to cracking cases soon.</p><p>The synopsis for Episode 15 teases that Parker will get yet another blast from the past when his elderly father, Roman Parker (played by <a href=#>Francis X. McCarthy</a>), moves in after getting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">booted from his assisted living facility</a> for bad behavior.</p><p>Luckily, he arrives just in time to help Parker and the gang out with their latest case.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>“NCIS investigates the death of a ride-share driver who was found after a car accident; Parker's dad, who is temporarily living with him, assists the team in their investigation,” the synopsis reads.</p><p>“It’s a worst-case scenario,” NCIS EP Steven D. Binder told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> of Parker’s new living situation. “We’re going to get insight on how [Parker] became the man that he is today. It’s about heart.”</p><p>From the looks of it, there’s a lot of Agent Parker’s story left to be told. Find out what happens next on new episodes of NCIS Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvMCrop6qXaGyosLIp55mppOewA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
