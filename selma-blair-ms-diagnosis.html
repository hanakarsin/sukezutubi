TheOscars took place without a host last night, and the event went surprisingly swimmingly. The awards didn't drag on needlessly and eternally, Black Panther cleaned up pretty well, and the talented Regina King and Olivia Colman were recognized for their outstanding performances, so all in all, it could have gone much worse."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Elton John held his yearly affair, and other celebrities made sure to secure invites to the glamorous Governor's Ball and Vanity Fair Gala. Just ask Selma Blair, 46, who was looking like a superhero when she was photographed by Mark Selinger entering Vanity Fair's afterparty in Beverly Hills.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>When my life flashes before my eyes, I want this portrait by @markseliger to be front and center. @vanityfair @frankieboyd @mrchrismcmillan @elizabethstewart1 @ralphandrusso @thetexastroya @tombachik @lyon_hearted @kristasmith @radhikajones Thank you. ðŸ–¤ #markseliger #glory</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Selma Blair</a> (@selmablair) on Feb 24, 2019 at 10:23pm PST</p></figure><p>The Cruel Intentions and Legally Blonde star arrived in a fabulously wispy black-and-pastel gown sporting a customized patent leather cane, complete with her monogram and a real pink diamond. It's the first time she's been photographed publicly since Selma revealed her multiple sclerosis diagnosis back in the fall.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Selma's been vocal about her challenges since her MS diagnosis.</h2><p>Back in August, Selma went to the doctor thinking she had pinched a nerve. But doctors found lesions on the actress' MRI and diagnosed her with MS. "I have probably had this incurable disease for 15 years at least," she emotionally penned in an Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "I am relieved to at least know."&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple sclerosis affects how the body and brain communicate. MS patients often experience difficulty walking, fatigue, and nerve pain.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In October, Selma posted a photo on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> in which she publicly addressed her illness. The news came as a surprise to many. "I have #multiplesclerosis," the actress bravely wrote. "I am in an exacerbation ... I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things."</p><p>"My memory is foggy," she continued. "And my left side is asking for directions from a broken GPS. But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don't know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best. Since my diagnosis at ten thirty pm on the night of August 16, I have had love and support from my friends ... I am in the thick of it but I hope to give some hope to others. And even to myself."</p><p>Her post was a long and emotional one: "I want my life to be full somehow. I want to play with my son again. I want to walk down the street and ride my horse. I have MS and I am OK. But if you see me, dropping crap all over the street, feel free to help me pick it up. It takes a whole day for me alone. Thank you and may we all know good days amongst the challenges."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Selma's producer boyfriend, David Lyons, has been extremely supportive since her diagnosis.</h2><p>Selma and Ahmet (son of Frank) Zappa haven't been together since 2006, but the actress has recently been photographed more and more with her producer and boyfriend David Lyons. He frequently posts adorable pictures of the Sweetest Thing actress, and the star even occasionally hacks his page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"My name is Selma," she posted on David's account. "I am writing on David's page. I adore him. You may too. I hope so. The more the merrier. I limp and stutter and talk like I am deaf sometimes," Selma emotionally and vulnerably revealed. "But he is unfailingly kind ... He is quite a catch. And I am not. Tell him I am cute. Thanks. Selma."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">#YesWeCane â€” Selma's cane was the most fashionable accessory at the Vanity Fair dinner.</h2><p>When Selma showed off her bespoke cane at last night's dinner, everyone wanted in. Luckily, she gave her followers an inside look at how it was made, and it's inspiring other people with disabilities to look into stylish canes of their own.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"How did I get so lucky?" Selma asked her followers on Instagram. "I wanted a special cane for #vanity fair dinner. So... @lyon_hearted went out and found patent leather and @bic_owen and he stitched it on. Hours of love put in. And then #tombachick made it especially magical. I burst into tears."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Selma isn't the only famous face of MS.</h2><p>Selma might be the latest celebrity to open up about her struggles with MS, but she's not the only person you've heard of with the disease. Former talk show host Montel Williams started a foundation to raise MS awareness, and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, better known as Meadow from The Sopranos has also been vocal about her challenges with MS.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtucBmmaWZmad6rr%2BMnaCan56kwKq%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
