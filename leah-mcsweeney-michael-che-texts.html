In 2017, the Real Housewives of New York alum claimed that the Saturday Night Live comedian sent her “rude” and “arrogant” texts after they exchanged numbers on the dating app Raya."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on for everything Leah said and screenshots of the text messages they exchanged.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How did the feud between Leah and Michael start?</h2><p>Leah allegedly met Michael on Raya, an exclusive dating app for actors, influencers, and some reality TV stars. This happened in 2016 before Leah joined Season 12 of The Real Housewives of New York. After meeting on the app, the pair exchanged numbers. But that would be as far as their dating experience would get.</p><p>Leah explained why during a January 2017 episode of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Improper Etiquette</a> podcast. “I met a comedian, I’ve dealt with a few comedians,” she began before going on to name-drop Michael.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @leahmob</a></figure><p>“They are the worst, I don’t even know why I entertain this but I have to say … Michael Che is so arrogant and so rude and disrespectful that I cannot even believe that someone … you’re like a D-list celebrity to me, whatever, that’s why I don’t even care that I’m saying his name. I’m not like blowing up Jay Z’s spot.”</p><p>Leah continued on with her rant by accusing the comedian of hating on women. She also claimed that Michael would text her random messages about his being overweight.</p><p>“Why are you on a dating app if you hate women? Literally, you’ve never met me and you’re texting me like I’m a stupid b---h … texting me and being mad rude,” she said. "He kept just texting me, going, ‘I’m fat. Does that turn you on?’ And I’m like, ‘you’re fat? I think I’ve seen you and you’re not fat, OK.’”</p><p>The ordeal was off-putting to Leah who added, “You’re trying to f--k with me? I don’t get it. You’re just a f--king dork wearing Air Force Ones [sneakers] at the end of the day."</p><p>The <a href=#>Bravo</a> star continued, "Like, 'cause you’re sitting up there writing your jokes on a little card, trying to figure out what the f--k."</p><p>She did give Michael at least one compliment by saying that his Netflix special Michael Che Matters is actually funny. But it was too late. “Arrogance is ignorance to me," she explained. "You don’t know me, you don’t know nothing about me, you don’t know we have mad friends in common and like, you’re gonna treat me like some stupid b---h? Like f--k you. I just can’t deal.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ooo y’all... it be the ones who are the loudest who somehow always end up being bad actors... or in this case the bad actress.

R u?” she asked.</p><p>In another text exchange from the following month, Leah wrote, “U hate me cus I’m white. Our conversations r everything to me btw. We have a lot of friends in common and if any one of them saw this I would b so ashamed.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I CAN NOT stop thinking about the leaked texts between Michael Che (SNL) & Leah McSweeney <a href=#>#RHONY</a> I have honestly never cringed so hard.

Why men think it’s [okay] to talk to a woman they’ve never even met in such [an] arrogant and gross way.”</p><p>She added, “It’s [definitely] a disease going around. It’s not just you. Don’t worry.”</p><p>Michael replied with nothing more than a thumbs up.
