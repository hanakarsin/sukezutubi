The APC Presidential candidate has a right to decide where he goes and what events to participate in as he seeks the mandate of Nigerians to be elected as the next President of our country.</p><p>“We want to make it abundantly clear again that Asiwaju Tinubu will not participate and will not attend the Arise News Town Hall meeting slated for Sunday, 4 December 2022 and any other ones it may plan before the February 2023 presidential election.</p><p>“The APC Presidential candidate has its schedule of campaign activities and other engagements within and outside Nigeria. One of such event is scheduled for Monday, December 5, 2022, at Chatham House in London where he will speak on Security, Economy and Foreign Policy.”</p><p>He reiterated that for the umpteenth time, no amount of blackmail, bullying and media bullying and innuendos by the owner and management of Arise News will change the position the party’s campaign had taken on attending town hall meetings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49sZpqok2K%2FprjEmqqeq12owaLAxKacp6xdlsBuwMinrJutXai1trqMmqWorJiav27AzrClZqCRobluucSeq6Kml2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
