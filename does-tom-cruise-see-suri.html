Although divorce used to be a very taboo thing, public perception has shifted significantly over the past several decades. Now, it's more surprising to hear of celebrities who have been married for any length of time ‚Äî especially after they have children.</p><p>Famous couples have been learning how to co-parent after divorce for many, many years, but not all seem to have solid relationships. Does <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> (Top Gun: Maverick) see Suri, his youngest daughter? New details involving Tom's messy 2012 split from <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> (Dawson's Creek) have been revealed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Does Tom Cruise see his daughter Suri?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Tom hadn't seen his daughter in several years. The publication reports the two were last photographed together in 2013 (the same year Tom sued In Touch for $50 million after the publication reported that he "abandoned" his daughter), which was only one year after his ex-wife and mother of Suri, Katie Holmes, filed for divorce. The lack of sightings likely has to do with Tom's controversial religion, Scientology. However, he previously denied Scientology's role in the estrangement.</p><p>"Samantha Domingo, the former follower who left the organization in 2004, told Us that the sighting was likely just for appearances," the publication said. According to Samantha, Tom doesn't have a relationship with her because he's "not allowed," as his daughter is no longer in Scientology.</p><p>Because of this, the church doesn't view Suri as Tom's daughter, but rather a "spiritual being in Tom's daughter's body."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>‚ÄúMaybe he did it for a photo op,‚Äù Samantha told the publication, ‚Äúto make it seem like he was connected so he wouldn‚Äôt be criticized.‚Äù</p><p>However, when Katie filed for divorce from Tom after seven years, the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reached a very quick settlement</a> and their divorce was finalized only 11 days after it was filed. With their divorce, Katie received primary custody of their daughter, Suri, who was 6 years old at the time, and Tom was granted visitation rights.</p><p>Suri ‚Äî&nbsp;who lives in New York with her mom ‚Äî is Tom's third child. His older two children are from his second marriage with Nicole Kidman (<a href=#>Big Little Lies</a>). The two actors adopted children while they were married and are now parents to 28-year-old son Connor and 30-year-old daughter Isabella Jane.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Not a morning person... üòÇ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Connor Cruise</a> (@theconnorcruise) on Mar 20, 2018 at 2:44pm PDT</p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reports indicate</a> Tom still has relationships with both Connor and Isabella (who allegedly remained in Scientology) following his 2001 divorce from Nicole.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>All that glitters is gold.. oh wait, it‚Äôs just another Instagram filter</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Bella Kidman Cruise</a> (@bellakidmancruise) on Aug 25, 2020 at 12:14pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Suri Cruise hopes to attend fashion school in New York City.</h2><p>In 2023, Suri ‚Äî who's about to turn 17 ‚Äî&nbsp;reportedly started the college application process. She's "leaning towards" studying fashion (and possibly music) in the Big Apple. With a wardrobe reportedly worth $5 million, Suri's passion for fashion is unmatched.</p><p>"Suri is applying to schools all over the place.
