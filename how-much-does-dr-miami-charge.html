"Nothing is free..."</h2><p>Even if you're an influencer or have reached a certain level of fame, Dr. Miami told Distractify that "nothing is free." The famous doc is known for his "mommy makeover" packages, which typically feature surgeries such as a tummy tuck, Brazilian Butt Lift, liposuction, and breast augmentation.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Dr. Miami's price list, a tummy tuck and BBL can set you back more than $20,000.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is a reason why he's considered one of the best, and he says that social media has resulted in an increase in the plastic surgery business in general.</p><p>"Because of social media, the number of procedures done every year has been growing in a way that it hasn’t in a long time," he told us.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While plastic surgery used to be a taboo topic, Dr. Miami explained that social media caused celebrities and influencers to "own up to it."
