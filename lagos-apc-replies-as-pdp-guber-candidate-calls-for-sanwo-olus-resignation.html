It is expected that the governor himself should have resigned instead of the arranged scapegoating of asking his commissioner to quit. He has made many unfulfilled promises to prevent these disasters and the attendant avoidable deaths,”&nbsp;Jandor noted.</p><p>He criticized Sanwo-Olu’s insensitivity and display of disregard for human lives by showing up at a social event in the faraway United States to present an award while the blood of the victims was still warm.</p><h2>Jandor Is Being Childish – APC</h2><p>In a swift reply, the spokesman for the APC in Lagos State, <strong>Seye Oladejo </strong>in a statement made available to newsmen on Wednesday described the call made by Jandor as childish.</p><p>Oladejo explained that Sanwo-Olu’s government has not hesitated to investigate the cause of disasters and wield the big stick where necessary.</p><p>According to him, while there may still be a few bad eggs in the sector who continue to circumvent the system, the state government remain committed to its complete sanitation.</p><p>“It is unacceptable, devilish and uncivilised for the PDP to celebrate the incident and dance on the grave of the victims in the name of politics. The Lagos State government remains resolutely committed to the protection of lives and property of all Lagosians. We will continue to do our utmost as the regulatory body for all manner of construction while we all as citizens also have a duty to comply with all rules and regulations,”&nbsp;The PUNCH quoted Oladejo as saying.</p><p>The statement added: “The childish call for the resignation of the governor is, to put it mildly, in bad taste. It reflects the palpable fear of the opposition of the imminent characteristic defeat during the coming elections. The reference to Mr Governor’s trip is puerile and infantile, even with the low standards of the PDP. Deputy Governor Kadri Obafemi Hamzat was at the site. So were other senior officials, who ensured that the search-and-rescue operation went on unhindered.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49xZqWZl6TAbq3PnGSrnaChtqa%2FjJqqZqiUpXqowcGeqWabkaOxqrDArZxmm5GhubR5xaipZquRo8Swec6lrKxloprAqrPNmquip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
