We rode horses up a mountain to go gold panning. I had a ring in my pocket and I was going to toss it in the gold pan and propose to @tattooker ... but of course, my soulmate beat me to the punch and proposed to me the exact same way."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She concluded with, "So I immediately got down on my knee too. I love you Daniel. One year down, forever to go. I said yes by the way, and so did he!"</p><p>Although the proposal happened over two years ago, Elle and Dan still haven't appeared to have an official marriage ceremony.</p><p>Prior to Dan, Elle was married to Andrew Ferguson from 2016 to 2017. She was also engaged to a previous boyfriend named Jim back in 2019, but that relationship dissolved before they could tie the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Elle King have any children?</h2><p>Elle and Dan may not have officially tied the knot just yet, but that doesn't mean that the two haven't taken other steps to establish their family. On Sept. 5, 2021, Elle took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce to the world that she and Dan welcomed to her first child, a son named Lucky Levi Tooker.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Very proud to announce the birth of our son, Lucky Levi Tooker.

The singer wrote at the time, alongside an adorable photo of herself, Dan, and Lucky embracing.</p><p>In the time since, it appears as though Lucky has hit the road with his famous mom, appearing at performances of hers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> that she shared in July 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmtsYykoKefXaKus77Inps%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
