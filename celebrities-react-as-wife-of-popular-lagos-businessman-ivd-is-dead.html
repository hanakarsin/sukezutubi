Why did she do this to her children? I just can’t stop wondering what her thought process was when she entered that argument with her husband. Was the best way to get back at your husband setting yourself ablaze? Will a man that beats you to a stupor suddenly show concern because you set yourself ablaze? Women, let’s learn to do better, please.”</p><p>@diiadem wrote: “This thing called marriage !!!!! Leave while you still can !!! I lost my cousin two weeks ago due to domestic violence !!!
