Speaking in the latest episode of the Spill With Phyna podcast, the singer claimed that anyone saving for the future does not believe in the coming of Jesus Christ.
According to him, Christianity and Islam are premised in the present, therefore, those with bank accounts and savings won’t make heaven.
The singer said most Nigerians would make heaven because they are poor, adding that only 48 million out of the over 200 million Nigerians have bank accounts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If you do, you’re just like me. Anywhere I dey go when I die, is where you’re going.’</p><p>“Because to believe in Jesus Christ is not to believe in a man or a personality. There are doctrines behind it. You must believe in the death and resurrection. Christianity and Islam are religions of now, the immediate. Everything is based on the premise that everything will end now: Jesus Christ is coming now. If you don’t believe that Jesus Christ is coming now then you’re not a real Christian. But all of you that believe Jesus Christ is coming now, you now have bank accounts for tomorrow? You’re saving for tomorrow. That means you don’t believe Jesus Christ is coming now.</p><p>“Poor people are the ones that will go to heaven. That’s what it means. In Nigeria, it’s only 48 million Nigerians that have bank accounts. The government revealed this during COVID-19 when Nigerians were agitating for stipend to be paid to their accounts as palliatives. The government said that won’t work because only 48 million out of 200 million Nigerians have bank accounts. So, hopefully, many of those that will go to heaven will be Nigerians because they have passed the first criteria.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BxZqimnK56sbvOq2SpnZ%2BluaZ51qKjpWWXpHq1u4yhnJqulaN6tLHUp2SkraSefA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
