As it has such a similar taste to the real deal, you may be confused. Here is all you need to know about artificial crab meat.</p><h2>What is imitation crab?</h2><p class=align-left>It is processed fish meat that also goes by the name <i>"the hot dog of the sea."</i> It is made from seafood, and it generally contains no crab other than the tiny amount of crab extract that's added for flavouring purposes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6e0e91f466a0a734.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most expensive cheese 2019 and its price will wow you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But what is imitation crab meat made of?</p><h2>What is imitation crab made of?</h2><p class=align-left>Have you ever asked yourself, "What exactly is imitation crab meat made of?" Well, the main ingredient in the product is surimi, a paste made from the Wild Alaska Pollock, which gives the product its mild color and odor.</p><p class=align-left>Pollock makes up 35 to 50% of the product in weight. Pollock is also used to make fish sticks and other breaded fish products.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from pollock, other imitation crab ingredients include:</p><ul><li><strong>Water: </strong>Water is added to the product to get the right texture and control production costs.</li><li><strong>Starch</strong>: Starch such as potato, tapioca, wheat, and corn is added to firm up the surimi and to make it freezable. If too much starch is used, the product becomes sticky and soft.</li><li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Proteins such as egg white and soy are added to the product to boost its protein content and improve its colour, texture, and glossiness.</li><li><strong>Sugar and sorbitol: </strong>These are added to help it hold up to freezing and thawing and increase the product's sweetness.</li><li><strong>Vegetable oil:</strong> Sunflower, soybean, and other vegetable oils are added to improve the product's texture and shelf life.</li><li><strong>Salt or sodium chloride: </strong>Salt adds flavour to the product. It also helps the minced meat form a sturdy gel. Potassium chloride may be used in place of salt.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f46e5e6d077edf64.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brisket bone or biscuit bone?

For imitation crab, the labels usually read something like <i>crab sticks/krab/imitation.</i></p><p class=align-left>Another thing you would like to check is the ingredients. The real deal usually contains crab and water alone (although sometimes citric acid may be added to prevent discolouration). The faux product, on the other hand, contains a long list of ingredients.</p><h2>Storing imitation crab</h2><p class=align-left>The vacuum-sealed product can be kept for two months if it is not opened.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt4l4o74skvv6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top continental dishes in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you buy it frozen, it may <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stay fresh </a>for six months.

The main ingredient in the product is surimi, which is made from Wild Alaska Pollock.</p><h3>Can you eat imitation crab raw?</h3><p class=align-left>Yes, you can, as the product is pre-cooked during the manufacturing process.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt1jsqci6gr3e8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The healing properties of scent leaf</span></p></a><h3>Why do sushi restaurants use imitation crab?</h3><p class=align-left>The product is used in place of the real deal because it is cheaper.</p><h3>How bad is imitation crab meat for you?</h3><p class=align-left>The product is higher in carbohydrates and lower in proteins, omega-3 fats, minerals and vitamins than the real deal. It also contains additives and preservatives (such as sugar and MSG) that may pose health concerns.</p><p class=align-left>However, according to Dr. Jae Park (a food scientist at OSU), <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via <i>Thrillist</i>:</a></p>...surimi has many health benefits. It's high in omega-3's, which aid in weight loss and help fight inflammation. When the fish is processed into surimi, it does lose the omega-3's naturally found in pollock, but pollock omega-3 oil is added to crabstick before it goes into your sushi. He also says it's a low-fat food, and depending on the brand of surimi seafood you're eating, it could be high in protein.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt32ufoan18dcg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Traditional Nigerian ugu sauce recipe</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The bottom line is that imitation crab is a good substitute for the real deal, provided you do not consume it too much.
