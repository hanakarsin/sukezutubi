One aspect of Vance's career that is impressing many voters is that the 39-year-old served in the Marines, making him the first military veteran on a major ticket seeking the top jobs in the land since John McCain ran for POTUS in 2008."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Vance is also the first former enlisted individual to seek America's votes for one of the highest offices since Al Gore was on the ticket 24 years ago.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did J.D. Vance do in the Marines?</h2><p>Vance, who <a href=#>was born James D. Hamel</a>, was previously a Marine Corps combat correspondent with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Times</a>. Indeed, he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deployed as a combat correspondent</a> from 2003 to 2007.</p><p>The would-be VP has written extensively about his time in the Marines, including covering the subject in his bestselling tome, <a href=#>Hillbilly Elegy</a>. In the book, which was turned into a movie, Vance wrote, “The Marine Corps taught me how to live like an adult.”</p><p>Vance also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> about his time in Iraq for the military, saying about his role in a PR capacity, "I was lucky to escape any real fighting but which affected me deeply nonetheless."</p><p>Previously, Vance said he'd been angry about growing up poor, and there were so many other things he felt were unfair about his life. But upon seeing a combat zone in Iraq, the now-vet wrote, "I began to appreciate how lucky I was: born in the greatest country on earth, every modern convenience at my fingertips, supported by two loving hillbillies, and part of a family that, for all its quirks, loved me unconditionally."</p><p>The Republican's 2016 essay is especially insightful now that he is running on the Trump ticket: "The experience taught me a valuable lesson: that I could do it. I could work twenty-hour days when I had to. I could speak clearly and confidently with TV cameras shoved in my face. I could stand in a room with majors, colonels, and generals and hold my own. I could do a captain’s job even when I feared I couldn’t."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just overwhelmed with gratitude.</p><p>What an honor it is to run alongside President Donald J. Trump. He delivered peace and prosperity once, and with your help, he'll do it again.</p><p>Onward to victory!</p>— J.D. Vance (@JDVance1) <a href=#>July 16, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Donald Trump pick J.D. Vance as his running mate because of his military background?</h2><p>Trump's VP pick was of course a very hotly-anticipated decision. Not surprisingly, the former president announced the news on Truth Social, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, “after lengthy deliberation and thought," that he'd made the choice for VP because he is "the best person suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States.”</p><p>There are many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">theories about why Trump landed on Vance</a> as his running mate, including that he will shore up votes in the Midwest, a potential trouble zone for the former Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>The two men also <a href=#>align on many issues</a>. What role did Vance's military experience play in Trump's decision, since it's well known that the businessman did not serve? For now, that isn't being discussed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7FuwsCnmp5lnZa%2FqrrErA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
