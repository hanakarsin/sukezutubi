"There’s no fruit and veg and I had a little cry in there. I’m a critical care nurse and I’ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours."</p><p>She went on to add: "There’s no fruit, there’s no vegetables and I just don’t know how I’m supposed to stay healthy. Those people who are just stripping the shelves have basic foods you just need to stop it because it’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please."</p><p>The video quickly went viral, attracting dozens of positive comments from friends and family.</p><p>"My heart with you Dawn Bilbrough," one user wrote.

I hope things will be better there in the UK."</p><p>While another added: "We need to prop each other up at the moment. Sadly at times like this, people show their true colors.
