We understand it's a private space, but wouldn't you want to make it feel cozy and safe? We know we would! It's the perfect place to escape from all the chaos in your life, but many individuals, including this one woman on social media, don't see it that way."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We understand it's a private space, but wouldn't you want to make it feel cozy and safe? We know we would! It's the perfect place to escape from all the chaos in your life, but many individuals, including this one woman on social media, don't see it that way.</p><p>On Oct. 9, 2023, a woman named Hazel (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@withhumanhands</a>) took to the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> the strange way her new roommate set up her bedroom. It's very strange, by the way.</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out more, including what the internet had to say about the roommate's bed configuration.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This woman revealed her new roommate's "fascinating" bed configuration.</h2><p>In her post, Hazel revealed that a couple of new roommates moved into her apartment on Oct. 1. She added that one of them has an "absolutely fascinating" bedroom set up, and we couldn't agree more.</p><p>Hazel included a sketch in her post, detailing her new roommate's bedroom. The bed is in the corner, right next to a window — seems pretty normal, right? Well, her pillows are placed toward the end of the mattress; this means that when she sleeps, her feet will directly face the window instead of the door.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>couple of new roommates moved in on the 1st - just caught a glimpse of one of their rooms and this is how she set up her bed??? absolutely fascinating <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aam0moDlfu</a></p>— hazel (@withhumanhands) <a href=#>October 9, 2023</a></figure><p>That arrangement completely freaks us out, and thankfully, we're not alone! Hazel's post racked in 13.6 million views and garnered over 1,900 comments from fellow X users who disapprove of the roommate's bedroom.</p><p>"Strategically, this set up is a nightmare, and personally, it is an insult," one user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to the post.</p><p>A second X user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, "Well, that person fears absolutely nothing. That goes against human nature, and I'm 10000% impressed and concerned. Wow."</p><p>"Not being able to see the door would make me so uncomfortable," someone else <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>. "Their head should be in the corner, that's the sweet spot."</p><p>A third person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, "Ain't no way I'd be sleeping not being able to see my door when my eyes open." Another user agreed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, "Yeah, that is odd. I wouldn't be able to sleep with the back of my head facing the door."</p><p>We're the same way; the door must be in our line of sight — not directly in front of us, though — or else our childhood fears will come back to haunt us throughout the night.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve been staring at this for five minutes.

Beginner move," someone else jokingly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a>, but one X user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a>, "Not if she's a ninja and can hear attacks coming and plans to backflip out of bed."</p><p>Another person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quipped</a>, "They are not afraid of the killer coming in the door because they are the killer."</p><p>"Your roommate is responsible for everything wrong in the world [right now]," an X user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>must be nice to have zero trust issues</p>— Kathrine Brandt (@kathrinepoker) <a href=#>October 10, 2023</a></figure><p>Some people tried to justify the roommate's room, including this person who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that the roommate chose to face the window "because the sunlight directly hits them in the face to wake them up. They likely don't use an alarm."</p><p>It's a decent theory, but in the end, most social media users told Hazel to move out of her apartment ASAP.</p><p>What do you think?
