Source: TikTok | @katizahleeWorking in the foodservice industry can oftentimes be a very thankless job. Between customers spitting in your face or throwing drive-thru temper tantrums for not getting discounts, to fulfilling massive last-minute orders, to not receiving a livable wage, it's not hard to see why so many restaurants are offering up some unprecedented incentives to get people to join their workforce."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The server complies and after grabbing a pile of money they see how much they received and say: "Really, are you serious?" seemingly impressed at the amount of money they received.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @katizahlee</span></figure><p>"You can keep it," the customer at the table says.</p><p>"You can keep it and you can keep the change. We're gonna bless you today," the diner continues, adding more money to the table.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @katizahlee</span></figure><p>The server thanks the couple again and then adds, "Happy International Women's Day."</p><p>A caption for the TikTok reads: "Blessed a nice lady today," and while the server in question genuinely seemed happy at the size of the tip, there were many folks in the comments section who didn't seem to appreciate the manner in which the gratuity was given to the server.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @katizahlee</span></figure><p>Some wondered why they would put them through a game to decide how much money they would receive if they truly wanted to "bless" the server; why not just hand them the $50 and go about their day?</p><p>Furthermore, there were folks who questioned the need for some individuals with social media accounts to record their acts of kindness, with many arguing that by doing so, it effectively negates the intention of the act of generosity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @katizahlee</span></figure><p>By posting about one's magnanimity for clout, many argued, is exploitative, especially when one encourages individuals who are beholden to tips in order to make a livable wage, to play a game for that money.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @katizahlee</span></figure><p>What do you think? Was it grimy for the customers at the table to ask the server to look "gamble" for her money as if they were playing a game of three-card monte?
