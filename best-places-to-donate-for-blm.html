The police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky., and the murder of Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, Ga., which went unaddressed for over two months, are just the latest injustices in a long and tragic history of violence and injustice against Black civilians."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It has become increasingly clear that organized groups of white nationalists have infiltrated the protests and are attempting to take over the cities, distracting from our righteous rage and powerful movement for the end of the police state in our communities. We see them protected by and working with the police. We want to lovingly encourage folks to not go outside tonight unless your plan is to protect Black lives. Let’s be clear. Young people have always created and sustained movements. We support the Black youth standing on the front lines defending our lives and honoring the memories of the many Black folks who have been murdered by police. Black people are taking care of Black people, as we always have and always will. While our lives are being threatened, we have also centered the care and needs of our people risking their lives on the front lines. We have seen the capacity of our communities to ensure our own safety, reinforcing our demand to #DefundThePolice. From supply trains to sites throughout the Twin Cities, to supporters navigating food and mutual aid to those most in need, to community medics treating burns and injuries from police, to healers coming together to hold collective space to process grief, to artists reflecting the beauty of our existence. Once again, we are affirming, we have exactly what we need. Our government has failed to provide justice for centuries; it is failing us again right now. We are angry, but we are not surprised. The police will not keep us safe, they never have and were never meant to do so.
