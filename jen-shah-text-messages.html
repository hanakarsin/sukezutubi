Now we obviously all knew there was a fat chance in hell that Jen would be showing up, but her presence will definitely be missed. Her storyline has been such a strong plot point throughout the series thus far and her overall volatile nature makes for great TV.</p><p>Still, we have that sit down with Andy Cohen to look forward. Oh wait, no we don't. Jen Shah took to Instagram on Jan. 19 to say that it won't be happening. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the post</a>, Jen says that she won't be doing the interview due to Andy and Bravo's "unwillingness to remove contractual provisions that would allow the network to legally make misrepresentations of me and my story..."</p><p>What's interesting is she seems to be incriminating herself with her own words in those text messages that were released.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here are some of Jen Shah's text messages for your reading pleasure.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@nofilterwithzack</a></figure><p>The popular Instagram account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nofilterwithzack</a> went through the Exhibits that were presented in Jen Shah's trial and pulled out text messages that were evidence against her and they aren't a good look.</p><p>The texts above all were sent on Oct. 6, 2017, and were referring to a lady asking for a refund. The texts read:</p><p>"Do we need to refund this lady?"</p><p>"Or is she done crying and ready to move forward?"</p><p>"Reyes, are you losing your touch with the ladies???"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by #NoFilter with Zack Peter (@nofilterwithzack)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@nofilterwithzack</span></figure><p>Texts to her assistant Stuart, <a href=#>who plead guilty back in November 2021</a>, from Dec. 4, 2017 read:</p><p>"So I flew to Palm Springs this morning and met w/ that guy and flew back.

As we know, Jen will be serving 78 months in jail as well as paying over <a href=#>$6 million in restitution</a>.</p><p>While it appears Jen won't be on Season 4 of RHOSLC because she'll be otherwise detained, we'd put money that if the show is still running in about six years, Jen has a contract guaranteed.</p><p>Make sure to tune into The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City on Bravo on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvedKhmKFlpJrFtXnMnqqsmZeawA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
