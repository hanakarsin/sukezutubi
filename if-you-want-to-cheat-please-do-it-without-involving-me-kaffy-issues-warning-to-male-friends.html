If you want to cheat on your partner, please do it without involving me, It is total disrespect to me and your wife whom I am most likely close to or have been fed by for you to want to use me to do cover up.</p><p>“It’s the audacity for me! You already know my stand against such as much as I may not tell you, you are at risk of me entering you that very instant. Don’t be calling your wife while you carry babe come dey tell her ” Kaffy is here” ( as per the event or gathering) abeg so as I dey there I hold your third leg. Giving your partner false confidence that you not where you can misbehave.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49wZqKeXa68tnnWmqWtZaSkeqS0xJqrZqicmq60sYydpmahpGLEqsDHqKytZZmjw7C41aKloGWdmnqsrcWfsGaho6jCpr%2BMsJirppmjtG7AzmakmqSVYrOztcSnm6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
