What's next for Ruth?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ruth makes a daring proclamation in Season 4, Part 1 of 'Ozark.' Will she die in Part 2?</h2><p>Season 4, Part 1 of Ozark marks a treacherous period for several characters, including Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery), the heroin dealer who stubbornly refuses to give up her lucrative business venture, her new husband, Wyatt Langmore (Charlie Tahan), and many others.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><p>Darlene and Wyatt are murdered in Season 4, Episode 7.
