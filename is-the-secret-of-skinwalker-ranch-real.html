Finding Bigfoot lasted a whopping 12 seasons and even earned a Discovery Plus special in 2021 — Finding Bigfoot: The Search Continues — yet Bigfoot was never found.</p><p>While we can't deny or confirm that the otherworldly oddities that've plagued Skinwalker Ranch for decades are real, we will say that The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch is a nonfiction docuseries.
