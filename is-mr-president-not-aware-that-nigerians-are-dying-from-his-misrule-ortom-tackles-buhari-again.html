Or is it possible that Mr. President is not aware that Nigerians are dying from his misrule?”</p><p>“The PDP is ready to rescue Nigeria from the insecurity and economic horror placed on Nigerians by the APC”, he said, adding that “the party is better prepared with laudable programmes on the welfare of Nigerians and to rebuild the nation from the APC tale of woes,” Ortom declared.</p><p>In the same statement, the Benue State Governor also called on President Buhari to declare the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Miyetti Allah</a></strong> group as a terrorist organization.</p><p>He said both the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM) have caused chaos in Benue and many other parts of the country.</p><p>Ortom added that as a way to curb their excesses, the anti-open grazing law has been activated in Benue State and will remain in force as part of measures to resolve the farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.</p><p>“Though the federal government’s measures on bandits now seems strong, the security challenges will only be adequately addressed if similar hard position is taken on Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, MACBAN, and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM) who have vowed and continued to cause mayhem in Benue State and other parts of the country because of the anti-grazing laws,” the statement submitted.</p><p>“For us in Benue State, the law has come to stay. It is irrevocable. In fact, we have maintained our position that Benue State has no grazing routes, reserves, or areas so whatever.</p><p>“It was enacted in good faith for peace and order in the state. It was done among other things to end the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49vZqKrXaK%2FbrzRnqqinJWjwW66zq1kmq%2BRp7JuwMeaq2ammZyys7XAp6pmmaKaeqXFyKeeZp6ipLputMisZKaho6fCrbGMqKmtp51iwaKvyqWcrGWSqrWivshmmKCZmaN8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
