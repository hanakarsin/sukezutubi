Of course, that sustained position in the group has afforded him a significant net worth. According to TheRichest, Anthony is worth around $20 million, a substantial sum that rivals any other notable musician.</p><p>The Wiggles wasn't Anthony's first foray into music, however, as he also incorporated a band in 1979 with his brothers, Paul and John, named The Cockroaches. Although that initial endeavor didn't exactly stick, he was able to translate that success into The Wiggles.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lachlan Gillespie's finances are a bit more of a mystery than Anthony's.</h2><p>The 35-year-old Brisbane-born musician is admittedly, a bit more mysterious than Anthony is, but nonetheless has served as the purple Wiggle since the band's current iteration incorporated in 2013. A member of the Unusual Commoners, an adult band that played a whimsical twist on traditional Australian, Irish, and Scottish folk songs alongside fellow Wiggles Anthony Field and Emma Watkins, he has clearly looked to expand his musical palate beyond just children's songs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebsAgeWiki</a>, Anthony's net worth is roughly $5 million, a sum he has accrued through his various musical endeavors.
