Source: Instagram/@mmargalisSwimmer Nic Fink is not one of the biggest stars of the U.S. swimming team, and in spite of his success at various World Championships, until the 2024 Olympics, he had never earned an Olympic medal. That changed on July 28 when he earned a silver medal in the men's 100m breaststroke."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Before Melanie transitioned to coaching, though, she was an Olympian herself and won a gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the 4x200m freestyle relay. Melanie was not able to travel to Paris to watch her husband compete because she's very pregnant.</p><p>“The doctor was like, ‘Yeah, we’re actually really kind of close for any travel, let alone international travel,’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nic explained</a>. “I know she’s here with me in spirit. Yeah, I'm bummed she can't be here, but it’s for the best of reasons.”</p><p>“I think she probably got her heart rate up as much as I did,” Nic said of his wife's reaction to the race. “I'm hoping she’s able to relax a little bit and stay hydrated and lay down because she was probably jumping up and down.”</p><p>In her own post on Instagram, Melanie offered her reaction to her husband's race. "Admittedly, not how I thought I would be watching <a href=# style=text-align:var(--ct-body-text-align) rel="noopener noreferrer">@finknic</a> swim in his 2nd Olympics, but I AM SO PROUD! 2x Olympian and now an Olympic Silver Medalist!!!!" she wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Melanie Margalis Fink (@mmargalis)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@mmargalis</span></figure><p>"Everyone knows about Nic’s full-time job while also being a full-time swimmer," she continued. "What people didn’t see was Nic doing 100 percent of all household chores, all the cooking and taking care of me for the first four months of this year."</p><p>In addition to being one of the best swimmers in the world, Nic also works a full-time job as a project manager for Quanta Utility Engineering Services,</p><p>“It’s kind of a group effort in the pool,” Nic explained. “And then obviously in work, they know that I’ll get my stuff done, and my hours may be a little different than other people’s. I’ve definitely answered texts like, ‘Hey, can I get this back to you in like an hour or so?’ And they are like, ‘No rush, you do you.’ They let me know when things need to get done by and I work around that schedule.”</p><p>Now that Nic has achieved on the biggest possible stage, he has to get ready for the next big test of his life: fatherhood. Given everything he was already managing, it seems like he's just the kind of person with the skills to become an excellent father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7akecWipaRlnZa%2Fs7XEnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
