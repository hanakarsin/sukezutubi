After the 2023 elections, APC may be dead and buried as a political party,” the report reads.</p><p>“While the duo (NNPP and LP) may emerge as strong contenders in the political arena in the future, from all indications, PDP appears to be the best option to adopt and support.</p><p>“All it takes is to sustain and tackle some of the problems and challenges this country is facing.</p><p>“Certainly, with proper consultations and inclusive appointments, which is mindful of the federal character principle with a sincere consideration of diverse issues such as religious affiliation, geographical location, and ethnic identity, which many believe will enhance justice, fairness and equity, after a careful evaluation of all the issues highlighted above, we hereby recommend the adoption of the PDP to all lovers of democracy in Nigeria for the 2023 presidential election.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49rZpuqlZa4qrrGZp%2Beq12ptaZ5wZ6qrWWUpLSivsBmpq2glad6r7vRrZ%2Beqp5isKm%2ByKyropmeYrmmrcOeqaxloJ6wrHnPq5ysoZSau7W1wKVknJmembalrdOeZK2nXajCsbzOq6tmmZapsrN5w66kqaGenHq1tc2uma5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
