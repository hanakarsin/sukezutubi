Fans everywhere want to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some reports claim Taylor Swift is engaged.</h2><p>On Feb. 17, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a> reported that Taylor and Joe are finally engaged after being together for almost five years. The pair have kept much of their relationship out of the public eye, agreeing not to post much of each other to protect their privacy, but that hasn't stopped multiple rumors about the couple's potential nuptials making headlines.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite multiple sources confirming to the outlet that they're engaged, Taylor and Joe have not confirmed the news to the public yet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The pair initially met in 2016 and started dating after Taylor's relationship with Tom Hiddleston ended. Taylor fans have long looked for clues about her exes in her songs, and while there are a litany of songs that are reportedly written about Joe, the pair keep their public appearances to a minimum (leaving even more for Swifties to decode).</p><p>The news of their potential engagement comes after Taylor was spotted leaving the studio, her left hand hidden in her pocket, suggesting to many she's hiding a ring.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Taylor's engagement ring look like?</h2><p>At this time, we're not quite sure what Taylor's engagement ring looks like — because she hasn't personally shared the news of her engagement yet. Like most things related to Taylor's love life in recent years, she'll likely keep these details very private until she's ready to share them with the world.</p><p>Since the reports of her engagement have yet to be confirmed by either half of the couple, it'll likely be some time before we get a look at the rock that could be adorning her ring finger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrHNoJignZ2au7V50aKloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
