Amaechi, too was not consulted. It is the same thing with Lawan.</p><p>“These are key party leaders who still have their bases intact. They didn’t play any role. Some of his kitchen cabinet members said he didn’t consult Osinbajo because he knew he would not support a Muslim-Muslim ticket.</p><p>“Amaechi, who appears to be the favourite of Northern Christian minorities, has been ignored. Now that Tinubu and his men seem to have run into trouble with the choice of a Muslim-Muslim issue, they’re looking for who to assuage the Christian community.”</p><h2>Muslim-Muslim Ticket</h2><p>Another source disclosed that the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee is worried over the failure of Tinubu to reach out to Osinbajo, Amaechi, and Lawan over the controversial <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Muslim-Muslim ticket</a></strong>.</p><p>He said while Lawan may not pose a severe problem, Osinbajo and Amaechi might be hard nuts to crack. The APC chieftain said the duo opposed a Muslim-Muslim ticket and might not openly campaign for Tinubu.</p><p>“The APC NWC waited for Tinubu and his camp to kick start the reconciliation process. That didn’t happen. So, Adamu had to step in. They’ve been reaching out and trying to ensure that the party is united.</p><p>“The party has lost the majority of Christian leaders. It will be risky to go into a major election like this and still ignore aspirants. The party is running against time, and they want to beat the deadline before campaigns start in September. It is not in my place to predict if they’ll succeed. But they’re very far from achieving that support they’re looking for. The coming days will tell if things will change. That’s our wish. The election will be a tough sell for APC,” the Northern APC leader told The SUN.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49vZqato6G2rnnMrqqloZ1ivLS1zZuYo6ddlrqiscKhoGakkayur3nRnp2uq5ViwbB5wZqapGWknru2rtRmmKxlkaWwbq7EoKCnq12nsqS7zZygpaGRqbawuoympq%2Bdo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
