Modu Sheriff said, “It is purely a private visit; you know Baba (Obasanjo) is an elder statesman. If Nigeria is a company, Baba is the Chairman and Chief Executive of Nigeria. So, I came for a consultation and had a private chat with Baba.</p><p>“If Nigeria is a company, Baba is the Chairman. I’m the younger one, so from time to time, I must come and greet my father, discuss with him privately and go back.”</p><p>When asked by reporters on whether his private chat with the PDP elder statesman was on the Nigeria project, the former governor insisted “I didn’t say that, it is a private visit.”</p><p>Speaking about his views on the 2023 elections, Modu-Sheriff told the journalist that their view is his view.</p><p>“Your view is my view, what is your view?
