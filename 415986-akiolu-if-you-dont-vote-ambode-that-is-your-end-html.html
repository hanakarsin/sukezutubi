If it doesn’t happen within seven days, just know that I am a bastard and its not my father who gave birth to me.</i></p><p><i>“By&nbsp; the grace of God, I am the owner of Lagos for the time being. This is an undivided chair. The palace belongs to the dead and those coming in the future. On Saturday, if anyone of you, I swear in the name of God, goes against my wish that Ambode will be the next governor of Lagos state, the person is going to die inside this water.</i></p><p><i>“For the Igbos and others in Lagos, they should go where the Oba of Lagos heads to. When they were coming to the state, they didn’t come with all their houses. But now they have properties in the state. So they must do my bidding. And that is the bidding of the ancestors of Lagos and God.</i></p><p><i>“I am not ready to beg you. Nobody knew how I picked Ambode. Jimi is my blood relation and I told him that he can never be governor in Lagos for now. The future belongs to God. I am not begging anybody, but what you people cannot do in Onitsha, Aba or anywhere you can not do it here. If you do what I want, Lagos will continue to be prosperous for you, if you go against my wish, you will perish in the water.”</i></p><p>He continued,<i>”I am for the progress, growth and development in Lagos, Ambode is highly cerebral, he’s a symbol and he is going to deliver the message which I the Oba of Lagos have said. And he will govern the state for another eight years.</i></p><p><i>“He is going on a mission and God will give him the wisdom and knowledge to fulfill that mission. Almost a year ago, I declared that Ambode will be the next governor of Lagos and it will not change.</i></p><p><i>“From time immemorial, the previous occupiers&nbsp; of this house will say what they wanted after consultation with other people. And this hasn’t change and it will not change at this time.”</i></p><p>Akiolu further said ,<i>”If not for the appeal from Asiwaju and my highly respected maternal father, the Awujale of Ijebu-Ode, all these that is happening today would not have happened.”</i></p><p>See the video below (Credits: Sahara Reporters)</p><p></p><p>Responding to the Oba's threats, Dr. Gordian Dimojiaku the Eze-Ndigbo of Amuwo-Oriade in Lagos assured the visibly angry monarch that they will do his bidding and support Ambode at the polls.</p><p>Some of the Igbo leaders present were, however, displeased by the tone of the Oba in conveying his message.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Oba of Lagos Reveals Why Men Cannot Stay With One Woman</a></p><p>One of the Igbo leaders who spoke to Daily Independent in anonymity, said the Oba’s comments were derogatory and insulting to Igbo residents in the state.</p><p>Last month, Akiolu had said Jonathan should not be blamed for the many problems of Nigeria as they were already there before he came to power.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXKBmHFtZpmbnrytwYyinWaxn6p6pbvNrWSvp6SaeqK5waibnmWkna61ecisZLKnpad6prrDZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
