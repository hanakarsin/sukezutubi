I told him plainly that I am not part of his plans. I told him to drop his ambition, and wait for next time.</p><p>“When he told me about his ambition, I asked him the states he thinks he can win in the west and in the north – he told me; but I was not convinced. I told him he cannot not win; so that he would not waste his time and money.”</p><p>Addressing Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra State, Eze said he is tipping the governor to become President of Igbo extraction.</p><p>“This is the person we are tipping to take over as Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in the time to come.
