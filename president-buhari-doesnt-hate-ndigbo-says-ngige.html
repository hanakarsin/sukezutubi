Mbazulike was one of the three old wise men that worked with me when I was governor in Anambra State. When he came up with this request I decided also that it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>“He said that it is what will give him the last joy before he departs from this planet. So, I am happy to be involved in it. The President also said that being an old man of 93 years this request is very heavy even though it has some implications.</p><p>“I acted as a facilitator, he copied me the letter to Mr President and called me on the phone when he had not gotten any reply. With my own copy, I met Mr President.”</p><p>Speaking on the choice of members of the delegation, Ngige said Mbazulike insisted that members of the entourage must be non-active politicians.</p><p>He added: “That was the guiding yardstick. Only two persons could not make it, General Ike Nwachukwu, retd., and the Obi of Onitsha because of some other appointments they had.</p><p>“Chief Mbazulike Amaechi initiated the visit and we decided that we don’t want any practising politicians to go with us.</p><p>“That’s why we didn’t bring any governor. We don’t want to drive a political change. I went to Mr. President to facilitate the appointment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FrZqmqlai2pbHNrWSbrZiWv6p5w6icrKakYrWiwMRmpZ2hl5e8br%2FAsqpmppeetKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
