It provides an opportunity to remember our heroes, the valiant Super Eagles, to whom our country made a promise of providing housing for winning the 1994 African Cup of Nations, which has remained unfulfilled before now.</p><p>“On behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria, it is a great honour for me to redeem the promise Nigeria made to these patriotic Nigerians, even if belatedly.</p><p>“Any one of them can pick houses from any of the 36 states.</p><p>“I invite you to pick from that which is being commissioned today.</p><p>“As the saying goes, it is better late than never and I have approved allocation to redeem the outstanding allocation to 22 members of the Super Eagles in National Housing Estate located in their state of choice, and their keys and title documents will be handed over at the commissioning in their state while the remainder of the housing is allocated to willing members of the public.</p><p>“The Micro, Small and Medium-size businesses that drive our economy were the ones who won the contracts to build these houses.</p><p>“Not only did their successful bids offer an opportunity for these companies and their employees, through them, but we have also unleashed a value chain of economic activities that improved the conditions of the mass of Nigerian people.</p><p>“They engaged suppliers who benefit from sub-contracts for the supply of building materials from sand to cement, roofing and plumbing material to doors and electrical fitting.</p><p>“In the process, Nigerians at the bottom of the pyramid such as artisans, builders, skilled and unskilled workers and food vendors were not left out of this economic value chain.</p><p>“These are some of the people our country remains committed to moving towards prosperity and away from poverty and we are already reaching them by providing opportunities for employment for those who were hitherto unemployed.”</p><p>The Zonal Director (South West) National Housing Programme, Dr M.K. Muhammed in his address stated that the land the project was built on was donated by the Minister of Interior when he was governor in the state.</p><p>“The National Housing Project is promoting local content in line with the Executive Orders 3 and 5.</p><p>“The use of available local building materials in the National Housing a programme (NHP) has stimulated the economy through the production and use of the materials,” the zonal coordinator stated.</p><p>The project commissioned on Monday consists of 72-units of the housing, comprising 24-units in a condominium (1 bedroom-4, 2bedroom-16, 3 bedroom-4), 28-units 2 (Two) Bedrooms and 20-units 3 (Three) Bedroom bungalows.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BtZpuqlZa4qrrGZp2gZaCnsrSxza2qZqCfqsCmv4ytpmZpaW6Bbq3FnKanZaOqvaa%2BjJ6YoKSVqHq1scCmZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
