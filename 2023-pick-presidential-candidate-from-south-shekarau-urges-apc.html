If we ignore power shifts, we are not being fair to ourselves and we are not fair to history. In my opinion, a power shift is necessary for all Nigerians to have a sense of belonging.”</p><p>Shekarau, however, noted that although the rotational presidency was not written in the APC’s constitution, he believed it was desirable for justice and fairness.</p><p>He said, “For instance, the present six geopolitical zones are not reflected in Nigeria’s constitution, but it is a good arrangement. You cannot implement any policy in Nigeria without considering geopolitical zones.</p><p>“You see, the North alone cannot produce enough votes for the president. Likewise the South; it is only when we come together. My belief is not only geopolitical regions, no state in the federation does not have a competent person to lead this country.</p><p>“I think that we should exercise patience and bring our brothers from the South close to us.”</p><p>The lawmaker while speaking on the possibility of the Peoples Democratic Party fielding a northern candidate, said both the PDP and APC faced the same dilemma.</p><p>“Each is trying to outsmart the other. My advice to the parties (APC and PDP) is that they should not look at zoning from political exploitation, but what should be just and fair. Fair play and competence of the candidate should be the guiding principle,” he added.</p><p>He emphasised the need for the ruling party to elect party officials from the ward to national levels in addition to setting up a modality on how to spread political appointments across the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5BxZmtoYmh6sbXCpGSpqpWotqWxza2gmqRdmK6vsMidmK2dXZu%2FsLmMrKaurJhiwKmxypqpmq1dqr%2BosdJmmKmbXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
