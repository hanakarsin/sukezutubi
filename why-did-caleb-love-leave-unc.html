He had an amazing 2022‚Äì2023 season, averaging 16.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, and shooting 37.8 percent.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why did Caleb Love leave UNC?</h2><p>According to Caleb, he left UNC because it was best for him, plain and simple. On March 27, 2023, he tweeted a goodbye message to the school and team. Part of it read, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken some time with my family to re-evaluate what‚Äôs best for me to continue to grow as a player and I‚Äôve decided to enter the transfer portal to continue my journey. Thank you, UNC family and community, for embracing a kid from St. Louis.

The most likely reason is UNC‚Äôs less-than-historically great 2022‚Äì2023 season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Pre-season expectations aren‚Äôt always helpful, which was true for UNC.</h2><p>The 2021‚Äì2022 UNC Men‚Äôs Basketball season was excellent. The team, led by Caleb, went all the way to the 2022 NCAA Tournament finals. They lost to the Kansas Jayhawks in a nail-biter. Caleb rolled his ankle in that game and still nearly tied the exciting game.</p><p>On April 5, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> covered the game and said, ‚ÄúConsider that throughout the course of the game, star forward Brady Manek took a WWE-level elbow to the head, dynamo guard Caleb Love twisted his ankle while working away from the ball, and Puff Johnson interrupted the game of his life by bowing over to vomit on the floor. (While KenPom doesn't record such acts, it's likely to be remembered as the first on-floor vomit in NCAA championship history.)‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The 2022‚Äì2023 UNC team, Caleb‚Äôs junior season, was ranked #1 in the pre-season. The team didn‚Äôt even make the NCAA Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament, let alone reach the finals. Unfortunately, the team couldn't live up to those expectations and Caleb took the brunt of social media abuse.</p><p>On the same day as Caleb‚Äôs Tweet, Tar Heel Illustrated publisher Andrew Jones was on the THI Podcast for the episode <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúWhy Caleb Love Transferred From UNC.‚Äù</a> The publisher agreed with Caleb‚Äôs decision to leave, saying, ‚ÄúPeople are going to maintain any narrative they want, but I wish they wouldn‚Äôt. I wish they‚Äôd tone it down with him, he gave this program an awful lot and now he‚Äôs making a really wise decision for himself and I think this is a good decision for North Carolina.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Based on the 2023‚Äì2024 NCAA Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament, Caleb made the right decision.</h2><p>Caleb was named the 2023‚Äì2024 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year</a>. The Pac 12 said, ‚ÄúThe league's fourth-leading scorer at 18.7 points per game, Love has done the majority of his damage where needed most ‚Äî away from home ‚Äî averaging a league-best 20.1 points in 15 games away from McKale Center.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">RJ Davis and Caleb Love both struggled during the Sweet 16 in the 2024 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.</h2><p>Caleb helped lead Arizona to the Sweet 16 in this year‚Äôs tournament. On March 27, 2024, before their game against Clemson, Arizona Associate Head Coach Jack Murphy told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, ‚ÄúEverybody had these preconceived notions about the kid coming out of Carolina and it couldn't have been further from the truth. He's been an amazing teammate, an amazing competitor, and a great learner.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, the Sweet 16 game against Clemson didn't go Arizona's way. Caleb went 0-9 from 3-point range. Arizona lost 77 to 72.</p><p>Caleb's old team, UNC, also lost in the Sweet 16 round. Former teammate RJ Davis also went 0-9 from 3-point range. UNC lost to Alabama 89 to 87.</p><p>According to former ESPN-er <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Berson</a>, it's the only time any two players have shot 0-9 or worse from 3-point range on the same day in NCAA Tournament history.</p><p>Even after that historically bad night, it shouldn't matter all that much for Caleb's future. He is currently projected to be drafted in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA Draftroom</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2abkaGyo3nLqK2eZZyarrexjK6lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
