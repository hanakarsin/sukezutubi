These are issues that our party insists must be investigated by the Department of State Services(DSS).</p><p>“As a party, the PDP charges President Muhammadu Buhari to reassure the citizens by immediately withdrawing the statement from his Presidency, relieve Isa Pantami of his position as minister and take a bold step to flush out terrorist apologists from the Presidency.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5FsZqmZnqmurrWMqameq5mZsq%2Bv2KxkrKyRqbKusc2tZJynnpu2s7nSZqqypaCWwanFjJ%2Bmq2Wkmr%2Bzu9GiqqZloJm9cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
