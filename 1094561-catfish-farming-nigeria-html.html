The biology of catfish is such that they can live without water for two days, breathing the usual air. They have both gills and lungs. This is a very strong and clever fish.

The female reaches sexual maturity by 6 months, but the best results are obtained at the age of 2 years. Usually during breeding, the parent herd is kept in separate tanks. The feed must be carefully balanced. The protein content of such feed should be at least 38%. In a day, each catfish should consume at least 1.5% of its weight. Feed is very important issue especially if we are talking about fingerlings. Of course, feed is the largest operating cost, we do not count expenses for a pond or a tank. There are different types of feed for catfish. Finely ground meal and flour-type feeds containing 40-50% of protein are used. To lower the cost for feeding you should try catfish farming manual feeding production.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6079a88c5badab6a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Infinix to launch most powerful gaming and entertainment smartphone ever</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Excellent results can be obtained by using feeders. One feeder is used for 10 squares of the tank/pond area. Manual feeding ensures a more equal distribution of food. This leads to differentiation of the fish mass. The African catfish, which is diluted in a controlled way, shows significant weight gain in a relatively short period of time. After the completion of all stages, the fish are sorted.</p><p class=align-left>Pools and trays after the cultivation of fish are washed and cleaned until the next generation.
