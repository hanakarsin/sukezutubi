What happened? And where is <a href=#>Taylor Frankie Paul</a>’s ex-husband now? Buckle up. This one’s a doozy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened between Taylor Frankie Paul and her ex-husband, Tate Taylor?</h2><p>The only thing wilder than Taylor and Tate’s sudden divorce was the reason why. This was intimately shared in a May 2022 livestream. In it, she revealed that <a href=#>she and her husband were “soft swingers.”</a></p><p>This meant that they were in an open relationship with strict rules. One rule was that they couldn’t have intercourse with other people. Another rule was that they had to be present for swinging activities.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @taylorfrankiepaul</a></figure><p>Taylor alleged that Tate asked for a divorce after she broke these rules. She admitted to taking things too far with one of their friends’ husbands. She also shared that other issues played a catalyst in their divorce.</p><p>“The divorce is not like, all because of this huge blow-up [in our friend group]. It was more 'cause I feel like we had a lot of other issues and then this was the tip of the iceberg,” she said.</p><p>Although she didn’t reveal names, Taylor did blow the whistle on other Mormon couples in Utah getting involved in this soft-swinging lifestyle. Many people speculated that this could include other popular Mormon couples on the app, such as Brayden and Mckenna Rowley, Conner and Whitney Leavitt, and Selver and Victoria Zalic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Paul (@taylorfrankiepaul)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Tate Paul now?</h2><p>Tate has stayed under the radar since all the drama unfolded. However, before he made his profile private on Instagram, he did share that he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expecting a baby</a> with his new girlfriend.</p><p>As for Taylor, she has reemerged online and has been sharing her new relationship with a man named Dakota Mortensen.</p><p>In 2023, Taylor announced that she and Dakota were expecting their first child together.
