We can practically hear the lyrics "Cash rules everything around me / C.R.E.A.M., get the money / Dollar dollar bill, y'all." Or perhaps you're a more dedicated fan, knowing every tune from 1993's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) to 2001's Iron Flag. Either way, you might not know the ins and outs of the Grammy-nominated <a href=#>hip-hop</a> group's humble origins.</p><p><a href=#>Hulu</a>'s coming-of-age drama series <a href=#>Wu-Tang: An American Saga</a> highlights the legendary American success story of the Wu-Tang Clan. Inspired by RZA's 2004 book The Wu-Tang Manual and his 2009 book The Tao of Wu, the series "tracks the Clan’s formation, a vision of Bobby Diggs aka The RZA, who strives to unite a dozen young, black men who are torn between music and crime." Created and written by Alex Tse and RZA, the series is set in New York circa the early-’90s —&nbsp;aka the height of the crack cocaine epidemic.</p><p>The gritty series premiered with a 10-episode Season 1 back in September 2019, and a 10-episode Season 2 premiered in September 2021. As for Season 3 — well, will there be a Season 3? Was the show canceled? Let's discuss the recent news.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 3 of 'Wu-Tang: An American Saga' finally has a release date.</h2><p>Wu-Tang: An American Saga has been green-lit for a third and final season, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.
