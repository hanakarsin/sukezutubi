Naija News reports that the party was reacting to a report that it filed a petition at the Tribunal seeking to nullify the election over non-compliance with the Electoral Act.
In a statement on Saturday signed by its Spokesman, Comrade Egbeola Wale Martins, the YPP said it never filed a petition to seek the nullification of the governorship election."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Moreover, if the party was interested in filing a petition, it would have been done through the office of the National Legal Adviser whose office is saddled with such responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>“Despite our reservations concerning some aspects of the election ranging from pre-election exclusion to vote buying and selling, these observed electoral infractions, however, remain insufficient to discredit the overall outcome of the election. Hence, it will be preposterous trying to fix what is not broken by engaging in a fruitless exercise to subvert the will of the good people of Osun State who have spoken loud and clear through the ballot.&nbsp;</p><p>“While we do not rule out the possibility of some imposters who may not be sufficiently inundated with the ideology of our great party being used by some anti-democratic forces, we assure the general public that the perpetrators of this ill-informed action will not only be investigated but sanctioned appropriately through our disciplinary committee and where possible, may also be prosecuted as the Legal Directorate, which is oblivious of this case has already commenced necessary actions.&nbsp;</p><p>“The party will like to reiterate to all our stakeholders the need to be circumspect, vigilant and resist the lure of being used by desperate politicians because of pecuniary gains as we will never allow our party to be used as a tool of destabilisation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BsZqirpaN6c3yRa2SyqKBiwLGxwKSqZqeeYrGzrcagoKefXZaxprjEpJxmmpWbvLOxjJ6jnpuknryvedOroJutnpa5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
