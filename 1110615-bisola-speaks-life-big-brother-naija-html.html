Looking back at Big Brother Naija…
I wanted that platform. I wanted that wide reach. People send me messages from Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, etc. on a normal day, before I entered the house, how many people would have known me?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I wanted that wide reach. People send me messages from Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, etc. on a normal day, before I entered the house, how many people would have known me? So yes, even though I did not win, I feel like I achieved my aim. Even if I won that money, It would still finish.</i></p><p class=h3><strong>Why she did not attend university</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>I wrote Jamb and I was jammed. It’s not like I did not try. I tried so many schools all over the country. It’s not that I wasn’t passing the exams; it was a problem of not getting funds. I did not have money to pay for certain things. I was even duped when I tried to enter LASU. That pulled me back and all this just made me discouraged. I also tried National Open University (NOUN) and you know it is very easy to get into NOUN, and at certain times you needed to pay certain fees. Believe me; it was difficult to raise N15, 000 at that time. I just decided that all of my energy let me use it into using my talent to feed myself.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkytrf4me8ahpq8.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>The war between Tonto Dikeh and her husband’s family continues</p><p class=h3><strong>How she used to go to her neighbor’s house to ‘stylishly’ ask for food because she and her daughter had nothing to eat</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>Sometimes when there was no food to eat at home, I take my daughter to my neighbor’s house under the pretext of watching television and stylishly feed my daughter and myself. That’s why I can relate to people because when you are down, you are down. But one cannot just stay down. I would love to help people get out of this type of situation.</i></p><p class=h3><strong>Her plans for the future:</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>I have so many things lined up. Obviously I want to do more movies and music too. I did get into the entertainment industry via music but I put it on hold for a couple of years so I’m going to revamp that access. I also want to make my own films in future and I‘m an ambassador for the One Campaign Poverty is Sexist so I will be pursuing that as well.</i></p><p class=align-left>Watch the interview below.
