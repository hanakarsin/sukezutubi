If you could imagine just about anything you want, you could likely find absolutely everything you imagined on Etsy. Even better, you know that you're getting something that's personally crafted, with no mass production to be found. Plus, they always seem to contain personal touches, like a handwritten letter, to make what you received all the more special.</p><p>Whether you use Etsy for everything or if you just love buying from the unique stock on holidays, you likely already have quite a few favorite sellers. Did they get the recognition they deserve as a part of this year's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy Global Design Awards</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: etsy</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How do the Etsy Design Awards work?</h2><p>The Etsy Design Awards, aka The Etsies, have the goal of honoring the best of the best sellers on Etsy. The awards go to the highest-quality items found on the site, while shining a spotlight on their global community of entrepreneurs, an especially important endeavor right now.&nbsp;</p><p>Through July 15, sellers could <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">submit an item</a> for a chance be named the Etsy Design Award Grand Prize Winner, which comes with a cash prize of $15,000. Ten other sellers are named Etsy Design Award Category Winners and awarded $1,000 each. Although last year, there were only five categories to win, Etsy has upped the number to 10: Jewelry; Bags, Accessories, & Shoes; Clothing; Art; Home & Living; Weddings; Paper & Party; Kids; Pets; and Vintage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: etsy</span></figure><p>What's more, winners of both the grand prize and the categories receive Etsy Ads and listing credits, mentorship from Etsy experts on key topics to help expand their businesses, and features on Etsy’s owned marketing channels. So not only does winning mean a cash prize, but it also means some powerful business boosts.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who won?</h2><p>This year, Etsy Trend Expert Dayna Isom Johnson judged the winners, but she's not the only one. Actress, icon, and Etsy lover Drew Barrymore judged alongside her.</p><p>“All of these incredible independent sellers, from all over the world, create the most amazing items, and with such heart and passion," Drew said of her role as judge, according to a press release. "I’m so happy to be able to honor this incredibly talented group of entrepreneurs."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: etsy</span></figure><p>While Drew and Dayna will be doing the judging for Etsy Design Award Grand Prize Winner and Etsy Design Award Category Winners, fans also got in on the action, after Etsy added a People's Choice Award.</p><p>So, who took home the prizes?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Grand Prize Winner: AdrianMartinus's Recycled Skateboard Credenza</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: etsy</span></figure><p>This gorgeous statement piece won brothers Adrian and Martinus Pool the grand prize of $15,000.
