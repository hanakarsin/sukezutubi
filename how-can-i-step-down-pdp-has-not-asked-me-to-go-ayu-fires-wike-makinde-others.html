The PDP is governed by rules, laws, regulations and conventions. He came through the process of the law and he will leave through the process of the law.</p><p>‘’Ayu spoke when he campaigned for this office. He said if a candidate emerges from the North, and the party says he should resign, he will resign. Right now, has the party spoken? Yes. What did the party say? The party gave him a resounding vote of confidence.</p><p>“Our appeal is that the party has spoken and it was a vote for unity, a vote for togetherness and purpose. Let us give peace a chance so that we can fight the battle in front of us to displace APC from office.</p><p>“As the chairman has said, the confidence vote was not a personal victory. It was a victory of all. It is a win-win for the party. He has appealed that let party faithful focus on the big picture of 2023. It is an appeal that we come back on one page. If we lose this election, Nigerians will not be happy with PDP. Since the PDP left office, the country has been going downhill.’’</p><p>Imobo-Tswam added, “We are still appealing. There is a phrase that says ‘What God cannot do, does not exist’ and we are saying ‘what diplomacy cannot achieve does not exist.’ That is what we are saying. Let them come back, so that we can win the election. In an election year, you need everybody. That is our message.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FrZqGnp2KworqMomSsrJWleqW71qdkqZygYrWiv4ynpq1lkai4prCMppxmrJ9itLB5wLKsZp6Zp7K0edaiop5lnZa4qrrDnmSorJiav7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
