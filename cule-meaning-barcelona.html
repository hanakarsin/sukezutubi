Rather, being a true culé goes beyond the soccer (excuse us, football) aspect.</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, culés agree that true Barça fandom goes beyond games.</p><p>A culé is "someone who can spot the little things that make our players great," writes one fan, "someone who understands the significance of the history of our club and why it means so much to Catalonians and Spaniards alike, someone who bleeds blaugrana."</p><p>Blaugrana, of course, refers to "blau" (blue, in Catalan) and "grana" (red, in Catalan), which denotes the colors of FC Barça's jerseys.</p><p>Most culés agree on one thing: "Barça is an emotion." "It's also entrenched in Catalan culture and history," explains another devoted fan. "I think you are a culé if you feel all those things. The love, passion, and dedication. Going through all the ups and downs and standing by Barcelona. There's no checklist of things you must be or do," they continue.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, being a culé "is a feeling, an emotion."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmMKtsYymnJqmmaO0bq7Aq5qepJ%2Bjrg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
