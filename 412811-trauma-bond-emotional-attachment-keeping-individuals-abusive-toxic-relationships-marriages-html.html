In most scenarios, abuse cases usually begin with love and affection before they suddenly turn to the opposite,” explained Serah Muindi, a Counseling Psychologist at Eldoret-based Hopewell Firm.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8c4bddfde55b9c9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Lies Kenyan Women Tell to Borrow Money from Men and Avoid Repayment</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The victims usually struggle to understand how people who excited their emotions suddenly turn to hurt their feelings.</p><h2>What is trauma bonding?</h2>“Most people in relationships tend to be taken by surprise when the person they loved turns against them. The worst part is when the offender apologises and the matter is settled making the victim regain trust. Sadly, once someone has been abused, the process continues,” added Muindi.<p class=align-left>This cycle usually<a href=#> cements a bond</a> between the hurt individual and the inflictor of pain.</p>“Trauma bonding often makes it possible for the abused person to form a strong attachment with the abuser to the extent of feeling sympathy for them despite going through difficult times,” she described the cycle.<p class=align-left>According to Muindi, the fear of the unknown leads many people to sink into trauma bonding without their knowledge.</p>“An individual who has been abused by those close to them will immediately begin to have fear of the unfamiliar. They often ask themselves how life will be without their partners or oppressors around. Others insist they are well familiar with those who abuse them thus able to tolerate the acts,” she noted.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/26f7cd97a25ed1ac.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chilling Video of Kenyan Man Slapping Lover Causes Uproar Online: "Heartbreaking"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The counsellor said some individuals think twice about the repercussions of leaving the abusive relationships and fears they develop they choose to stick by with hopes of changing the person’s character in their favour.</p><h2>What causes abusive marriages in Kenya</h2>“At times those subjected to abusive marriages will always put a line of defence by protecting the oppressor. They would make assumptions that if they love their aggressors harder and forgive them more they would become nice. This is what makes the victims remain in unsafe situations. The oppressors on the other hand take advantage of this situation and hurt them more,” Muindi indicated.<p class=align-left>Caroline Okanda, another psychologist, opined that lack of social support system, poverty, and lack of collateral are some of the contributors to trauma bonding.</p>“Similarly, lack of insight due to unavailability of counsellors or someone to share with them is also partly to blame because they hardly know they are in a problem hence don’t know way out,” Okanda said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3194b0536e1ebfdb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Asks Men to Stop Siring Kids, Leaving Single Mothers Struggling: "Tabia Mbaya"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She observed that if the trauma is countered, it will be possible to break the bond between the oppressor and the victim.</p><p class=align-left>Okanda further noted that the victim must avoid self-blame over situations they are in, arguing that such a move would continue keeping one in the toxic relationship.</p>“It will also be wise to talk to someone and get professional assistance on how to overcome the issue,” she added.<p class=align-left>TUKO.co.ke had earlier listed <a href=#>signs that indicate one is in an abusive relationship</a> or marriage and how to turn the situation around.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkGtvamldqb%2BiwcyaZJunnpl6prnOraCoppGheqLA05qaoaWVo8Fut8Sep6Kml2K2r7DIr6CdrZGhwG6twa6qoq6VYsGwxMicZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqKNiuqK%2B0aKYoJ2jY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
