We also had to ask about her future in reality television because although Vanessa was seen as a villain on Queer Love, fans still took a liking to her anyway.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is TV personality Vanessa Papa from 'The Ultimatum: Queer Love' now?</h2><p>The Ultimatum: Queer Love filmed more than a year before it finally premiered on Netflix. In the time it took to film the show and for Vanessa to watch it back at home, a lot had changed. And since this was Vanessa’s first foray into reality television, it was a lot for her to take in once she watched the show and received reactions from viewers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Reliving a version of an experience you had years prior is a very confusing experience," Vanessa shared with us. "Knowing the entirety of what happened, and having to come to terms with what people will actually get to see was hard. I had never been on reality TV before, so I didn’t fully realize what I was getting myself into."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But since then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa</a> has been working on her acting career and, she shared with us, "life’s pretty fun right now."

And at least now, she explained, she knows what she wants. She shared that she’s "not just looking for someone who fills a void," but instead for someone who "makes [her] feel more alive."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vanessa Papa has worked with the Trevor Project.</h2><p>Besides following her dreams as an actress and looking for romance, Vanessa also donates her time to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Project</a>.

Having that visibility on TV is great," she said. "I think the show lets people see that queer relationships are deep, complicated and real."</p><p>As for the question of Vanessa going on reality TV again to find love at some point?</p><p>Her coy response was, "I would consider it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq66vsdKsmGasmJp6trjToqSarKWierLBxJ6pZqSfq7Juus6w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
