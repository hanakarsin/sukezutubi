We were never there, none of our operatives was there. It’s not from EFCC, it’s not an EFCC thing.</p><p>“And I’ve called all the non-security and re-enforcement agencies in the country and they also denied that anybody has been sent to the house to carry out any search or arrest.</p><p>“In fact, it came to my knowledge when a very senior lawyer called the director of legal. We were having a meeting in the evening, and he asked to give the phone to the director of operations that we were also having a meeting together with.</p><p>“And when I came back, because I had just stepped out, they said that this is what is going on and we just laughed because we understand that there are a lot of people that want to put us at loggerheads with the judiciary.</p><p>“And you know that in the work that we do, the judiciary is our biggest partner, and of course they are just trying to cause problem where there is no problem,” the EFCC Chairman said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5JpZrCgqWLEpnnLmqygoJWZerDCxKtkq52gpL%2B1ec6fZJ6ek5h6s63InaCnn12fwrTAyJycZqWRp8Zuu8Oio6KrXaeytLXDnqWcnV2Xrritjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
