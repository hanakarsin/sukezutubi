Source: TwitterThe new trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi came out, and there's a lot to be excited about in there. Family dynamics, kick-ass action sequences, Carrie Fisher's final appearance, spaceships blowing up other spaceships.

"You canâ€™t remove them. You physically canâ€™t get rid of them. And digitally removing them is an issue and a lot of work, so letâ€™s just roll with it, play with it. And so I think he thought, 'Well, thatâ€™s great, letâ€™s have our own indigenous species.'"&nbsp;<p>The final design for Porgs stemmed from Rian Johnsonâ€™s vague request for "puffin people," which he interpreted as "so cute Lisa Frank will be pissed she didnâ€™t invent it first."&nbsp;</p><p>The more you know.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcGZqaF9mfnCmkLKcgImmZL2wvsasZKyskad6uK3RrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
