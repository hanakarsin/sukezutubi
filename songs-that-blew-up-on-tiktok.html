The short video sharing platform has grown to dominate the social media space over the last few years, and in that time has become a hub for all things trending in every single capacity. One of those things is music, and there have certainly been quite a few songs that have seen a sizable jump in popularity just from TikTok's influence alone.</p><p>With all of that being said, what are some songs that blew up on TikTok? Keep reading for ten of the most notable tracks that the app propelled to stardom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. "Blinding Lights" — The Weeknd</h2><p>Although it can be attributed to a variety of sources (including a massive push on the radio), The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" broke more records as a song than most artists do throughout their entire career. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, there are nearly 30 million views on videos that have been tagged with the track.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. "Savage" — Megan Thee Stallion</h2><p>If there's any other bonafide TikTok hit to mention, it's "Savage." Indeed, Megan Thee Stallion's bouncy track captivated so many people that over 15 million videos have been made using it on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>. If that isn't being a savage, we don't know what is!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. "Dior" — Pop Smoke</h2><p>Although his life was cut tragically short at just 20 years old due to gun violence, Pop Smoke's music lives on through his fans — hundreds of thousands of which have taken to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> to use his street anthem "Dior" as the soundtrack to their videos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4.

"As It Was" — Harry Styles</h2><p>It's not like Harry Styles needs much help promoting music nowadays, but when he released "As It Was" in 2022, it became a massive hit with users on TikTok. Harry does not have an official TikTok account behind which the app can quantify how many videos or views "As It Was" has in total, but a variety of user-submitted snippets of the songs have racked up millions of videos and views on the platform.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. "My Type" — Saweetie</h2><p>With only a few years under her belt in the hip hop game, Saweetie has already come out of the gate swinging with a slew of hit tracks beloved by millions of fans worldwide.

"Say So" — Doja Cat</h2><p>It's hard to deny Doja Cat's impact on pop music at this point.
