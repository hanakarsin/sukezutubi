It was actually Mammand Daura that went to visit Jonathan. Also, the national chairman visited Jonathan twice last week. He met Jonathan late in the evening and they spoke till about 1am. The visit was for about four hours.</p><p>“Discussions are still ongoing and that is why the APC is willing to allow Jonathan to face the screening even though he didn’t submit his form ahead of the deadline.”</p><p>According to another source, Jonathan is not willing to contest for the APC presidential ticket against long-time members like Bola Tinubu, Ahmad Lawan, Yemi Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and others.</p><p>He said the former president will only join the race if he is assured of emerging the consensus candidate of the party.</p><p>“Jonathan is a newcomer in the APC. He has no delegates of his own. You don’t expect him to be contesting openly against Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo and others. He will be setting himself up for defeat if he does that,” said the APC chieftain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FvZpqfkZ67brbOp5itoJGjeq6xxK2qZpmgmMBurcOapK5lkZextrjLmp%2BiZZGoerPBy6KloGWglr%2B1xYymmLJloJ6wrHnHoqRmp6aav27AyKesm61dlrqiscKhoGanpJ2ys7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
