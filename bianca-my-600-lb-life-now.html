She noted that her mother struggled with alcohol addiction, and that she would often give Bianca food in order to placate her while she drank.</p><p>While things did improve for Bianca when her mom married her stepfather, she soon dealt with tremendous loss. Her mom, her stepdad, and her biological father all died within the span of just a few years.</p><p>After she had her son, Simeon, Bianca did try to improve her situation by getting weight loss surgery. She met Romonte following both of their operations, and her "bad habits" crept up again when she got pregnant with their daughter, Marcia.</p><p>On the show, Bianca explained that, because of her weight, Romonte was doing the lion's share of the housework and the cooking for their family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though Bianca contributed to the household by working at a call center, she wanted to see if she qualified for another surgery to better her health for the sake of her kids.</p><p>When Bianca, Romonte, and her two kids first went to Houston, Texas to see Dr. Now, she weighed in at 604 pounds.
