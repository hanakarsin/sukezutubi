Some personal drama, however, has cost the makeup mogul big time when it comes to collaborating with NARS Cosmetics. Let's take a closer look at what happened between Manny and his fellow beauty influencers that caused this chasm.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He‚Äôs also known for epic drama with Jeffree Star.</h2><p>Following a close friendship, Manny has had a long-standing feud with Jeffree Star. This came on the heels of accusations of Jeffree being racist, and a controversial tweet in August 2018 that featured Manny alongside fellow beauty vloggers Gabriel Zamora, Laura Lee, and Nikita Dragun.</p><p>The group was giving the finger to the camera, and the caption read, "B---h is bitter because without him we're doing better.‚Äù</p><p>Jeffree clapped back by accusing Manny of being a social climber, and unearthing a series of controversial tweets from vloggers in the photo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Like this one?

This practice is not uncommon in the YouTube beauty space ‚Äî in what became known as Dramageddon.&nbsp;</p><p>This cancel culture doesn‚Äôt just impact creators‚Äô influence, but also their revenue stream, since views translate into dollars in the YouTube world.</p><p>As is customary following any kind of YouTube scandal ‚Äî no matter which space an influencer is in ‚Äî Manny issued an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">apology video</a> as a form of damage control.</p><p>Gabriel ended up saying he was cutting Manny out of his life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>accusing him</u></a> of using and dumping Jeffree, and positioning Gabriel himself as a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He also fell out with NARS Cosmetics.</h2><p>In August 2019, Manny said he lives for makeup brand NARS‚Äô new, highly sexualized branding.</p><p>That show of support came a year after Dramageddon, and it was actually on a NARS Cosmetics brand trip in Ibiza, Spain, when Manny and co. started the Jeffree drama.

He says it‚Äôs their prerogative and that the video is not an attempt to get back on their PR lists.</p><p>First on the list is MAC, and the second is ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî&nbsp;NARS.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúNARS has taken me off their PR list,‚Äù he shared. ‚ÄúThis one I wholeheartedly understand.
