Fortunately, she was able to handle things the only way she knows how: Swiftly!

While performing her song "Bad Blood," she was heard yelling ‚Äústop,‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not doing anything‚Äù and ‚Äúleave it‚Äù in between lyrics. Naturally, many fans were confused about what was happening as that dialogue was not a part of the song.</p><p>It was later learned that she was addressing a member of security who appeared to be mishandling a conflict with a fan and her friends.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>üö®| Taylor tried subtly multiple times to defuse a situation between some fans and security.

Instead of trying to peacefully resolve the situation, Caitlin explained that the security guard started ‚Äúharassing‚Äù her and her friends.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@caityg33 href=#>@caityg33</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @Sonya (Eras 4/29) Its me, hi, im the problem @kellyinglis326 @Taylor Swift <a title=erastour href=#>#erastour</a> <a title=lincolnfinancialfield href=#>#lincolnfinancialfield</a> <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a> <a title=eras href=#>#eras</a> <a title=badbloodtaylorsversion href=#>#badbloodtaylorsversion</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Caitlin Gabell" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Caitlin Gabell</a></figure><p>She continued: ‚ÄúTaylor noticed that I was having fun and that he didn‚Äôt like it, and she didn‚Äôt like it, and he basically got escorted out."</p><p>She also revealed that Taylor Nation offered her and her group free tickets for Taylor's next concert.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one user tweeted</a> about the incident: "Imagine Taylor Swift defending you‚Ä¶..I would evaporate into oblivion."
