It is very unfortunate that this generation is not aware of this and they will continue to fall victims of tragedies at the Likoni channel and blaming the Kenya Ferry Services,” Ali added<p class=align-left>On April 29, 1994, the MV Mtongwe Ferry bound for the mainland capsized just 40 meters from the port, killing over 250 people on board.</p><p class=align-left>It was reported that the ferry which could only carry 300 people was overloaded with over 400 people, causing it to capsize.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5bbf796cf6ce9cdb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kakamega: 10 police officers injured in confrontation with bullfighters for violating COVID-19 rules</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3f89da1d5ad7e5be.jpeg><p class=align-left>Yusufu Said, who witnessed the aftermath of the Mtongwe accident, claimed those who survived the accident had seen a mysterious “buibui clad woman" who appeared and stood in the middle of the ocean as they battled for survival.</p>“It was amazing to hear people saw a woman dressed in a black buibui floating in the air and minutes later, the ferry began to tremble and subsequently sank,” said Yusufu.<p class=align-left>He claimed the bodies which were recovered had no blood, which was very strange even though some had been eaten by sharks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1bc55a0ae781e806.jpeg><p class=align-left>The elder advised that a cow or several goats could have been sacrificed then to avert the tragedy from reoccurring.</p>“These “buibui” women are seen but come as a warning of the impending tragedy. If nothing is done then calamity occurs . There are some individuals who come here at the Likoni channel wanting to commit suicide, but what many don’t know is that the ocean spirits call them to drink their blood,” Yusufu alleged.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8b7aef9dddc5a06c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Embarrassment as clergymen's doves of peace thrown into the air refuse to fly</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another elder TUKO.co.ke spoke to on condition of anonymity claimed even the workers at the Kenya Ferry Services especially the Mijikendas know what is supposed to be done to avert the ferry tragedies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5bbf796cf6ce9cdb.jpeg><p class=align-left>He revealed some of them perform the rituals secretly without involving the relevant elders making the sacrifices to backfire.</p>“When performing rituals, you have to involve elders with a calling to appease the spirits. It is not just a matter of slaughtering a cow or goats, you have to chant some words and use magical portions for the rituals to be effective,” he said.<p class=align-left>Ahmed Nasser, another elder, told TUKO.co.ke that even some drivers of vehicles that enter the ferries are influenced by the spirits, making it difficult to salvage them whenever they plunge into the ocean, no matter how good and careful the driver or rescue teams are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/6b4a0574ab82b5a7.jpeg> “The drivers whose vehicles plunge into the ocean are experienced drivers, but when the spirits hover, they cannot do anything about it. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2e4812c63872e632.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>US celebrities continue partying amid COVID-19 pandemic</span></p></a>If they are lucky enough, they can alight before they drown. Many vehicles which have sunk with people inside have never been recovered,” Naseer stated<p class=align-left>He suggested that a sacrificial ritual has to be performed by elders to appease the ancestors who would then release the bodies by pushing them off shore or allow them to float.</p><p class=align-left>The elder claimed so many things happen during the voyage and at some point, ferries just stall mid-ocean for hours causing panic among those on board.</p>“Many complain that it is because the ferries are old but in the real sense, that might not be the case. In the past, elders were consulted and after special rituals were performed, the ferries would begin to sail smoothly once again.<p class=align-left>In the month of January 2021 already, at least three accidents have happened at the ferry.</p><p class=align-left>A bus that had two occupants slid from the ferry to the ocean and it took quick response from the public to rescue the two.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a6b2e7a1b477916e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Githurai: 5 members of the same family found dead</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After that, a trailer plunged into the the ocean also from the ferry, with security firm car crashing at the Likoni Channel few hours later.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Story by Monica Wambugha - Tuko correspondent, Taita Taveta</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have an inspirational story you would like us to publish?
