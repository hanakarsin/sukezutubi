At the time, Paper Rex’s duelist, Something, stated during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post-match press conference</a> that his team “did it for fun” and that “no emotions” were involved.</p><p>Another teammate, F0rsakeN, quickly added, “Actually, we got a warning for teabagging.”</p><p>Both teams were teabagging each other, so it’s unclear if EG also received a warning from Riot.</p><p>Alecks, Paper Rex’s coach, expressed he doesn’t “really like it when they teabag because they get carried away, and I usually tell them off in practice if they start doing this.” He continued, “But I guess because EG doesn’t mind, why not?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Not only were the players teabagging, they were shooting the dead bodies of opponents, taunting each other with trash-talk, and waving at each other. Wild as it sounds, it isn’t uncommon for things to get messy during an esports match in the game or verbally between teams on stage.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fans understand this, as noted by a Reddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> reacting to the teabagging warning — some of which calling Riot “stupid and weak” for its response.</p><p>“You won’t build any rivalries if teams need to be robots and friends out there,” said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor</a>.</p><p>Another esports fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that it’s “kinda weird of Riot to feature EG trash-talking … in the teasers that they do then get mad at [Paper Rex] for doing it back.”</p><p>For the most part, fans believe both teams were simply competing, and a warning wasn’t necessary. Paper Rex ultimately bested EG, but the Riot warning may have conversely nipped at the wild energy some fans enjoy seeing for the rest of this Valorant Champions tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6xsdFmqZ6wXamyonnBmp6goZ6cerit0aegp59dq66tu9Gapa1lk52urrzIqKWs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
