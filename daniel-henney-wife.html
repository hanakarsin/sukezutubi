And as it turns out, the actor has had his eye on that role for a long time now.

He also starred on Matt Simmons on Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, and when that spinoff was canceled, he brought the character to <a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He wanted to play Lan in ‘The Wheel of Time’ back in 2011.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Daniel recently revealed how he thought about playing Lan a decade ago.</p><p>"I do this vision board thing, where I think about something I want to do career-wise or a goal,” he said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamespot</a>. “So, about 2011, not really knowing about the books, I saved a picture of a cover of The Eye of the World on my phone. I saw Lan on his horse and Moiraine next to him, and I wanted to play a character like that someday.”</p><p>He also said that he hoped to draw on his dad’s “real dry sense of humor” to play the straight-faced character of few words—but teased that the character will be in the thick of the action soon.</p><p>“He does have some really great moments in episodes four through eight,” the actor said. “It’s been a real pleasure of mine to do those moments because he is such a physical and stoic character so when I get a chance I kinda go for it.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He’s rumored to be dating Ru Kumagai.</h2><p>A few years ago, fans started thinking Daniel was dating Ru Kumagai — an actress who has appeared in the TV shows <a href=#>9-1-1</a>, Adam Ruins Everything, and Good Trouble — after they posted Instagram photos with each other’s dogs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ru Kumagai (@rukumagai)</a></p></figure><p>In April 2018, however, Daniel’s reps at the agency Echo Global Group denied any romance between the two. “After checking with him, we are letting you know that they are actor colleagues that met at a friendly gathering and that he is just close colleagues with Ru Kumagai,” the agency said in a statement at the time, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AceShowbiz</a>. “It is not true that they are dating.”</p><p>Despite that denial, however, the duo continued to appear together on social media, and Ru even posted photos from Prague, Czech Republic, which is where Daniel <a href=#>has been filming The Wheel of Time</a>, according to a report on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allkpop</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vtcSlZKGdnqOyunnWop2e</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
