Source: FrasierWe will never escape the deluge of reboots for old TV shows, old movies, and old actors who maybe don't need a comeback. People have become a bit deadened to all the zombie shows lurching around primetime, so it's rare that anything gets people excited. But what if we said....Frasier?
Yes, Deadline is reporting that a potential reboot is being discussed by Kelsey Grammar and CBS, with Grammar appearing once more as the titular character."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, there are some pretty big changes that would have to happen for the show to work, since for one, John Mahoney has died since the series ended. Mahoney played Frasier's father in the show, a contrasting voice to his two sons' snootier worldview.</p><p>It's possible the show would be more like a spin off, rather than centering on Frasier himself. That means lots of potential pitches going around the writer's room. And if big Hollywood writers can pitch, so can the Internet!&nbsp;</p><p>Ideas for Frasier reboots have been circulating on Twitter and some are better than others.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>frasier reboot but he's in full beast garb the whole time, and nobody ever comments on it <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3pV5OG55pm</a></p>— Dinosaur Dracula (@DinosaurDracula) <a href=#>July 25, 2018</a></figure><p>Some are far more adventurous than others, recasting Frasier as a sort of counterpoint to The Rock.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have an idea for the Frasier reboot <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h28DtN4XYl</a></p>— Peter Miller (@peter_miller) <a href=#>July 25, 2018</a></figure><p>Others are trying to figure out a way to get around the loss of Mahoney — and inject the show with even more Niles, an idea of which I heartily approve:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I AM FEELING SO MANY THINGS RIGHT NOW. More Frasier?! More importantly, more Niles?!?! But Frasier without John Mahoney? Frasier forced to care for Eddie after his father's passing? Maybe that would be amazing?

For example, the fact that Kelsey Grammar IS Frasier.
