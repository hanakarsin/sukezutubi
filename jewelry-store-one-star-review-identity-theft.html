Amazon is filled with one-star reviews of companies and products from folks who weren't happy with the way their local delivery service brought them their product.</p><p>And, in the case of this viral Reddit post from a local jewelry store, it doesn't seem like the customer's poor experience was the store's fault.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Reddit user @Bobolobo posted a screenshot of a jewelry store's response to a customer's one-star Google review.

Do not give them your information," the person wrote.</p><p>However, the business expressed their disappointment that the individual would call out the shop like that, seeing as they had spoken with them earlier and explained the situation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The owner of the store wrote: "[name crossed out] we are deeply saddened that you felt you needed to post a negative review about our company online. You were a victim of identity theft and it was not a fault of [store's name crossed out] and sadly we were both victims."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The company continued, "As you are aware and we physically showed you evidence of an individual who came to our store with a fake ID saying they were you, a fake credit card with your name on it and used a Synchrony account with your name and address attached to it to attempt to buy a piece of jewelry. We flagged the purchase immediately and did not release the jewelry and refunded your card immediately."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"You personally called us 'Hero's' [sic] in our store and said you were going to 'Tell the news how appreciative you were of us for catching the fraud before it was too late.' We have cameras in our store that recorded you in our offices saying this. You knew it was not a fault of ours but for some reason still felt the need to post this. If possible for you to and see it in your heart to be able to do so, please remove this negative review."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to the jewelry store, they never completed the purchase and actually did the reviewer a solid by alerting them to the fact that someone was stealing their personal information and was attempting to make unauthorized purchases.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter | @wrrvradio</span></figure><p>Redditors had a lot of theories about what could have possibly happened in this scenario.

Do you think that the vendor's you've dealt may've had something to do with it?
