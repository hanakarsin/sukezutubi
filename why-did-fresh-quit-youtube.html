He streamed and recorded his gameplays on <a href=#>Twitch</a> and YouTube wracking in millions upon millions of subscribers and views. That was until one day he just stopped.</p><p>Why did Fresh quit YouTube?

His channel grew quickly, with him gaining 7.74 million subscribers and the videos having millions upon millions of views and counting.</p><p>Fresh had been posting about a video everyday up until 2022, when he just quit without so much as a word to his loyal subscribers. Finally, seven months after stopping, Fresh made a YouTube video to explain where he had been.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Fresh explained that at the time of his disappearance, he had "a lot of things going on in the real world." Some of those "real world" things were focusing on his health and starting "a new life."</p><p>Fresh only posted four videos after that, before once again disappearing, but he was pretty busy in the interim.</p><p>According to a video posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Riskhimself</a>, Fresh got super into crypto, buying Bored Ape NFTs, among others.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>YouTuber @Justicul also said that Fresh was focusing on making music. He DJ'd multiple events, even one for Coldplay. He also rented out studios to create his own stuff.</p><p>But his biggest project was co-creating a game, "World Boss," with fellow gaming YouTuber <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LazarBeam</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Not only did Fresh create his own video game, but made his own video game company. A trip over to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> tells us that he owns Amino Gaming, but that isn't Fresh's only business venture. He is also a co-founder of a new betting platform, Shuffle, as well as a Partner at a VC fund, WWVentures.</p><p>So yes, Fresh might have quit YouTube, but it's only because he is building his empire. That's very impressive for a 21-year-old if we do say so ourselves.</p><p>Although some of Fresh's subscribers might be disappointed in his lack of gaming content now on YouTube and Twitch, he obviously has big things in store for the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aeoprAqXnQrqCtZamkwrXBwZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
