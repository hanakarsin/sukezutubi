They are currently the only club in the top five European leagues that are yet to suffer a defeat so far this season.</p><p>But Victor Boniface’s return in April is expected to be a huge boost for Bayer Leverkusen, which is aiming to win its first German Bundesliga title. The team is in the Europa League knockout stage and also in the DFB-Pokal semi-finals.</p><p>Ahead of Bayern’s Europa League round of 16 second leg tie against Qarabag FK in Germany, Xabi Alonso described Boniface’s potential return to the pitch as a “very good” development.</p><p>“His (Boniface) development is very good; the recovery is going in the right direction. That’s very positive,” Alonso said, according to German publication, Bild.</p><p>“We expect Boniface soon, I don’t know, but it won’t be until May, maybe April, and that’s very good for us, having Boniface back. Boni works very well, with great professionalism, twice a day. We need players who have the desire to be back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BsZrGZkp56orjOp6qoZZGju7DBzZycrGWnnbKvedWimq2nomKvsLrIn5icnV2stq24jKucra2io3q1u4yfpqiskpa5rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
