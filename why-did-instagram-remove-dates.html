Source: Getty ImagesIt seems like every day, Instagram makes another seemingly random change to their app that confounds users — from adding notes to pushing video content over photos. These constant changes have pushed many frustrated users away from the platform. And now, some are reporting another missing feature."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Some even took to other social platforms, like X, to air their frustrations. "What exactly was Instagram trying to achieve by removing dates from posts?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one user</a> asked.</p><p>As of writing, it seems that the <a href=#>Meta platform</a> hasn't addressed the reason for the change, which is only affecting some users. Theories suggest that it could have something to do with boosting the app's mysterious algorithm or that it could be a way to disguise the age of content on Discover page posts.</p><p>However, it's also possible that it could just be a glitch or bug that came with the latest update.</p><p>Regardless of the reason, this new change could cause major issues for users, including brands and companies that utilize Instagram to advertise limited-time deals or events. It can also lead to an awkward situation in which you like someone's post that just happened to pop up on your feed, but really it's three months old, and now it looks like you've been stalking their page.</p><p>Because Instagram hasn't addressed the issue, there's no word on whether or not users will be able to toggle this change on or off (similar to post like counts) or if there will be a fix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ahnqjBorPRmqRmqpWivLexjJ2YrZ2j</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
