Source: HBOGame of Thrones is arguably one of the best television shows of the past decade (not counting Season 8). 
Some of the stars of the series, such as Emilia Clarke (who played Daenerys Targaryen) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow), reportedly made more than $1 million per episode by the show's final season."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So, just how much was Jason making on Game of Thrones? Here's what we know about his salary.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Jason Momoa's salary on 'Game of Thrones'?</h2><p>Who can forget the Dothraki king Khal Drogo (Jason) in GOT? Though the character is initially viewed as a barbarian by his lovely bride Daenerys, she eventually falls in love with him and becomes pregnant with his child. However, GOT doesn't deliver happy endings and Dany is forced to kill her beloved after he succumbs to a vegetative state in the Season 1 finale.</p><p>While fans would think Jason's role in the popular HBO series would propel his career, it seemingly had the opposite effect. "I mean, we were starving after Game of Thrones," the actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instyle</a>. "I couldn't get work. It's very challenging when you have babies and you're completely in debt."</p><p>The 41-year-old is currently married to Lisa Bonet and the couple has two children together Lola, 13, and Nakoa-Wolf, 11.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>So, why wasn't the actor booking any roles after Game of Thrones? According to Jason, he may have played Khal Drogo a bit too well.</p><p>"For a while afterward, a lot of people bagged on me. It hurt me a lot. People thought I didn’t speak English," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>He added, "They didn’t know I was playing a role. I'm nothing like Drogo. I'm like Drogo when I'm being lovey and close to the woman I love and being nice, but his other half is not me. But then everyone fell in love with Drogo when they rewatched the show."</p><p>Though it has not been disclosed how much the actor made during his time on Game of Thrones, many outlets report that Jason is currently worth $14 million. Yes, he's no longer "starving" or in "debt."</p><p>A few years after playing Khal Drogo, Jason got his big break and was cast as Aquaman in a string of DC Universe films. Jason's career has continued to sky rocket and the actor has starred in a number of films and televisions shows since his GOT gig.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DC</span></figure><p>Fans of the hulking star can catch Jason in his next big role, starring alongside Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and many more A-list actors in the 2021 highly anticipated film Dune.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mpKiln5Z6qK3MnmSonl2ptbO7zZ6qZquRoa6zxQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
