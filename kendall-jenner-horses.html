Maybe she professionally competes in horse shows every weekend or maybe she has a bit of a gallop and her favorite movie is Black Beauty."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Maybe she professionally competes in horse shows every weekend or maybe she has a bit of a gallop and her favorite movie is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Beauty</a>.</p><p>Model and TV personality<a href=#> Kendall Jenner</a> isn't someone you'd take for a former horse girl. But her eyes light up whenever she gets on the subject of horses. She's been an avid equestrian for years.</p><p>‚ÄúI gravitate towards everything horse. They‚Äôre like very, very interesting, like, beautiful spiritual beings," she said during Season 3, Episode 4 of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre, like, telepathic," she added.</p><p>During the episode, she took her sister <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> for a ride at her ranch, revealing in an aside that they used to ride horses together as kids. "We would go to Wyoming every summer and ride and go up on the mountains," Kendall said. But as they grew up, Kylie hopped off the saddle.</p><p>So, how many horses does Kendall actually have? And where is her horse ranch located? Here's what know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @kendalljenner</a><p>Kendall Jenner riding a horse in 2013 at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How many horses does Kendall Jenner have?</h2><p>Kendall is currently believed to have four horses with a baby horse on the way, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Pets</a>.</p><p>One of her horses is Little Joe, a gorgeous white stallion. It is unknown how long Kendall has hid him, but Little Joe was previously seen during an episode of The Kardashians <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Kendall brought him to True's fourth birthday party</a>. Half-sister <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> later posted a photo on her Instagram Story of the stinky present Little Joe left in the yard.</p><p>Kendall also has an American Paint horse named Arizona. Kendall shared photos of Arizona on her Instagram Story in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Kendall and her new horse named Arizona üêé ü§ç</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Maebai6363637</a> in <a href=#>KUWTK</a></figure><p>In 2018, Kendall also acquired two European Warmblood mares named Dylan and Belle. We don't hear too much about Belle, but Dylan definitely is talked about.</p><p>In fact, there was some drama with Dylan in the get-go as Kendall began referring to her as "Dragon." This was problematic at the time as Kourtney Kardashian's ex <a href=#>Scott Disick</a> was dating <a href=#>Sofia Richie</a>, whose horse also named Dragon passed away. Fans weren't sure if Kendall was referring to Dylan as Dragon intentionally.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>dylan! I love my dyli dragon baby</p>‚Äî Kendall (@KendallJenner) <a href=#>February 3, 2018</a></figure><p>But that's not all we know about Dylan. In a November 2022 episode of The Kardashians, Kendall announced that Dylan was having a foal (aka a baby horse). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing it via surrogacy, which is really interesting,‚Äù she noted before adding, ‚ÄúBaby daddy [the foal‚Äôs father] is really sexy‚Äù and that the stallion has competed at the Olympics."</p><p>Kendall has yet to update fans on if Dylan had her baby, but fingers crossed that she'll share more during Season 3.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where does Kendall Jenner keep her horses?</h2><p>During The Kardashians Season 3, Kendall said that she had her own barn for her horses. She previously told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> in 2018 that she keeps her horses Belle and Dylan in a show barn, called Huntover in Bell Canyon, Calif. The owner of the barn, Mark Bone, has trained with her since she was 13 years old.</p><p>However, when Kendall isn't at Huntover, she's been spotted riding at Hidden Hills Equestrian Ranch in Bonsall, Calif. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was even photographed</a> riding there once <a href=#>with her alleged boyfriend Bad Bunny</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKvsMClo2ailaO7pr6Moaarq5WofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
