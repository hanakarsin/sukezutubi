While the lead of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> isn't obligated to propose to his final contestant, it's become an almost unspoken rule after 28 seasons of the reality show.</p><p>Interestingly, there are instances where outcomes seem more favorable for the lead of The Bachelor and his final pick when a proposal isn't part of the equation. After all, the Bachelor lead only has about six weeks to develop romantic connections with his contestants!</p><p>With that in mind, what happens when a proposal doesn't occur? Is a contestant only deemed the winner if and when the Bachelor lead proposes to them? Read on to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happens if 'The Bachelor' lead doesn't pick a winner?</h2><p>On the rare occasion that The Bachelor lead doesn't pick a winner, they typically return to their regular life without an engagement. If you recall Season 26, regarded as one of the most disappointing seasons in Bachelor history, leading man Clayton Echard ruins his chance at a happy ending.</p><p>Despite proposing to Susie Evans after kicking Gabby and Rachel to the curb, she rejects him, leaving Clayton as much of a bachelor as when he embarked on his search for everlasting love. However, Clayton and Susie did reconcile after filming ended, but their relationship eventually fizzled out for good.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Matt James technically didn't pick a winner for his season.</h2><p>If there was ever a couple who proved Bachelor Nation wrong, it would be <a href=#>Matt James</a> and <a href=#>Rachael Kirkconnell</a>. Matt chooses Rachael as his final rose pick, but he doesn't propose to her because he isn't ready for that commitment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rachael Kirkconnell (@rachaelkirkconnell)</a></p></figure><p>The couple's journey takes a tumultuous turn when old photos of Rachael at an antebellum-themed event surface on social media, alongside other troubling allegations from her past. Ultimately, the couple confirmed their split during the 2021 "After The Final Rose" special.</p><p>Rachael took to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to issue several apologies following the backlash, notably refraining from making any excuses for her past actions. In April 2021, Matt confirmed that he and Rachael had reconciled, and as of March 2024, they are still together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Remember Juan Pablo from 2014?</h2><p>Back in 2014, <a href=#>Juan Pablo</a> was Bachelor Nation's least favorite leading man. Nonetheless, his season did produce <a href=#>Claire Crawley</a>'s memorable line, "I'd never want my children to have a father like you."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>If we're defining winners as women who receive proposals on the show, then technically, Juan Pablo's final choice also falls short (although some might argue she won in the long run). Juan expressed a desire to pursue a relationship with Nikki Ferrell — but he didn't want to propose.</p><p>Nicki and Juan Pablo ended up calling it quits before any wedding bells rang.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Wait, does Joey Graziadei pick a winner? Spoilers ahead!</h2><p>Since ABC revealed <a href=#>Joey Graziadei</a> as the next Bachelor, many of us devoted fans have felt a sense of relief. And now, as his journey draws to a close, it's safe to say he's emerged as the finest leading man the Bachelor franchise has seen in recent memory!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Given our collective hopes for his happily ever after, the burning question arises: Does Joey choose a winner? Well, of course! According to Reality Steve, Joey proposes to <a href=#>Kelsey Anderson</a> in the finale. The fan-favorite reality TV blogger further <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that they remain engaged to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaPAbrXFZpmam5iaubC%2BjJ2mnqueqXqxtcKkZJplp567r7HR</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
