I used the N21,000 that I was able to save to start the business and now I make at least N400, 000 a month,” the suspect told The SUN.</p><p>“The boom in my business began when I started supplying bread to bandits.</p><p>“Initially, I used to go around their camp area to sell bread in small quantities. Luckily, it was during one such movement in 2019 that I met Mohammed from Galadimawa and he bought ten loaves of bread and took my phone number.</p><p>“I sold the bread N200 each instead of the regular market price which was N170. The next day, he called me and said that the bread was so sweet that I should bring 20 pieces.</p><p>“The day I took 20 pieces and I met with three others who were with him that day. They told me that they would like to be buying in a larger quantity and I told them that I did not have enough cash. We agreed that they would pay the entire money before I would bake.</p><p>“They started with N20, 000 worth of bread and gradually increased it to N50, 000 a day. After removing the cost of ingredients, I make as much as N150,000 in a week.”</p><p>On his part, Abubakar said he started working for Magaji three months ago and did not know that selling items to criminals is illegal.</p><p>“I started working for Magaji about three months ago,” he said.</p><p>“I am paid N500 and a loaf of bread every day. My job is to join and bake the bread and also sell them in the various communities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5ByZqGnp2K2brnApJxmpmRlfax5zKilraCcrnq0wc%2Bpo7Khnpx6o77EmptmrJ9ir6K6w6KrrGWZo3qsrcOupZplkpa4pr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
