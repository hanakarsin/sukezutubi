Thatâ€™s what happened to Charli Dâ€™Amelio recently, and as one of the biggest TikTok stars to date (who wasn't so famous before the social media platform rose to popularity), it could have been career suicide."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thatâ€™s what happened to <a href=#><u>Charli Dâ€™Amelio</u></a> recently, and as one of the biggest TikTok stars to date (who wasn't so famous before the social media platform rose to popularity), it could have been career suicide. While rumors can be a powerful thing, the truth of what happened to Charli is still bothersome in the grand scheme of her internet stardom.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, did Charli D'Amelio delete her TikTok?</h2><p>The rumor about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Charli deleting her TikTok</u></a> account came about because she did, in fact, delete a TikTok she made and uploaded. On May 18, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Charli posted a TikTok</u></a> in which she opened up about some of the internet bullying she has endured on the platform and revealed some of the hateful comments that have been left on her videos. It was a heartbreaking reality check for those who follow her, but who have also felt the need to berate her on social media.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Shortly after she posted the video, however, Charli deleted it. Thus, the rumors about Charli deleting her TikTok as a whole were born. But, never fear, the TikTok superstar is still alive and kicking on the app and, if anything, the hurtful words from her haters only fueled the encouraging ones from her fans.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Deleting TikTok would be detrimental to her career.</h2><p>Before she rose to fame on TikTok, Charli was one of millions of teenagers who hadn't quite hit it big on the internet. Granted, sheâ€™s still a teenager, so thatâ€™s expected. But TikTok has allowed her to showcase her personality, dance skills, and ability to maintain tens of millions of followers and billions of likes on her various posts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>my nuggetðŸ¥º | photos by @bryant</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dixie Dâ€™Amelio ðŸ–¤</a> (@dixiedamelio) on Mar 16, 2020 at 1:16pm PDT</p></figure><p>If Charli were to delete TikTok, it would be like saying goodbye to her career. Chances are, she knows that as much as anyone. The fact that she deleted her TikTok about her feelings is problematic, in that she should feel that her TikTok is a safe space for her. Unfortunately, thanks to internet trolls, itâ€™s not.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Charli was one of the many members of Hype House.</h2><p>Part of Charliâ€™s celebrity status comes from the fact that she was a member of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hype House on TikTok</u></a>. For those uninformed or who are considered "boomers" (God help us all), Hype House is a content creator collective that comes together to make videos for the entertainment of their individual sets of millions of social media followers on multiple platforms.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>my second family :)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>charli dâ€™amelio</a> (@charlidamelio) on Dec 5, 2019 at 1:35pm PST</p></figure><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Charli was once a part of it</u></a>, she and sister Dixie Dâ€™Amelio branched off. At the time, the sistersâ€™ rep told The Hollywood Reporter, "When the Hype House started to become more of a business, Charli and Dixie stepped away from that aspect. While their businesses are separate, their friendships with the members continue." Apparently, things are still going well for Charli solo on TikTok, as she has risen through the ranks quickly.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How old is Charli D'Amelio?</h2><p>As far as the top of the top on TikTok goes, one common thread is that the biggest TikTok stars are teenagers. The same goes for Charli, who is 16 years old in 2020. If she already had millions of TikTok followers and more than 3 billion likes by the time she turned 16, thereâ€™s no telling how far she can take her fame. Letâ€™s just hope she doesn't do something silly like delete her actual TikTok account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecKhmKukmWKxprjErZxmrJmgwbC3</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
